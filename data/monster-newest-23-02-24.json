If you were a family member of the victims you would find it very difficult to watch or even think about the existence of such a show that gives him any notoriety, In that sense I personally found it best to watch it as if it were a work of fiction. In which case it was very well done and compelling with an emphasis on trying to understand the psychology behind the killings. I did have to pause it a couple of times and watch something mindless in between but generally it held my attention."},{"id":"rw9526250","title":"Evan Peters and his MAGNIFICENT acting in this MAGNIFICENT show!","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"28 December 2023","text":"This was my first Jeffrey Dahmer movie/series that I saw and i have to say. This series definitely feels real.Evan Peter's EXTRAORDINARY acting skills in this disturbing crime/docudrama series is just done SO WELL!This series definitely manages to capture the moment of the Jeffrey Dahmer cases and especially what Jeffrey Dahmer used to do.The acting is great, the story is great, the characters are great, the crime/docudrama/thriller (or whatever you wanna say) is great, the runtime on each episode is great. There's just SO many things in this show that manage to make this feel so real! It's a VERY disturbing which is also VERY well made.I don't know THAT MUCH about the history of Jeffrey Dahmer but what I DO know is that he is a cannibal, serial killer and s3x offender, and this show managed to recreate the story of Jeffrey Dahmer in a VERY well way. Evan Peters has VERY good acting in this series and this serious WANTS to take itself serious and it DOES. It definitely does."},{"id":"rw9522515","title":"A mind blowing !!","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"27 December 2023","text":"I had my reservations about whether or not to watch this and I went back-and-forth for several months before deciding finally to watch it. Is it well made? Yes. Is it addictive? Yes. Did I watch it having to pause it several times due to the intensity of the material? Of course. The series is bingable and watchable. Is it appropriate to watch knowing these are real victims? I don't know. I did feel sad watching it but I am glad I watched the whole thing because I learned a lot. I learned that he could have been caught years earlier if only the racist and homophobic police would have done their job properly.

This was so horrifying and yet satisfying to watch and a part of me felt guilty for enjoying it so much! I actually stayed up until 3am just so I could finish it so it must have been good because I love my sleep! I love that the victim's stories were such a big part of Dahmer because I think sometimes so much focus is on the character and trying to understand the mind of the killer that we as humans forget that lives were destroyed by this person that committed the crimes/killings and actually seeing the background of the victims and also their families made it hit home to me."},{"id":"rw9500577","title":"Brilliant series","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"17 December 2023","text":"If the police could have taken action prior to 17 deaths.

The highlight of the series is the performances of the actors. Every actors has lit up the series with their display. Jeffrey Dahmer is played by Evan Peters and he is outstanding. He gives that serial killer vibe.Series makes you indulge in itself. Jeffrey Dahmer's story revolves around how he turned into a serial killer. The timeline changes between each scene due to the non-chronological presentation of the story. I like this way of representing a story. We see the event first and then it unfolds itself about how it happened.Background score is amazing. Specially those whale sounds in the end of every episode.If you are curious about Dahmer, the serial killer, this will fulfill your thirst.

The choices of characters and supporting actors are excellent, and the acting is really good. This is one of the reasons why I particularly like this series. Secondly, I read a lot of reviews about the fictionalization of the plot. I think this is a series that has a lot of adaptations, probably because the director wanted to simplify it... and focus on the issues of race and police. I have to say that if you want to know more about Dahmer's true situation, there are clearer documentaries. But if you want to emphasize the importance of racial, criminal, and political emphasis on the disadvantaged, I like this movie."},{"id":"rw9419107","title":"Not usually a docudrama or true crime guy","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"6 November 2023","text":"Even Peters is extremely talented in any role he plays, I know he has a past of playing dark characters but I think his portrayal of Dahmer was eye opening for some. The entire horrible incident that was this mans life must've been very difficult for Peters to play as but there were things I learned about the case that i didnt know beforehand. I do wish the movie wouldve stayed stricter to the facts because it really is an eye opening movie and absolutely crazy that something like this could not only happen during this time period but the blatant disregard for humanity people had even back then.

Rarely I cannot finish a movie/tv show but this was just a waste of time... I had to quite somewhere in a middle of the 3rd episode...I though that would be a nice thing to watch right after Mindhunter to see the \"other perspective\" but it is dull...If you like horrors and enjoy watching some random killer's homo sex fantasies and how he devolves/evolves you may like it... For me it was just a waste of time. Sure creepy, scary etc. But this will just leave a bad taste in your mouth and nothing much else to be honest. I wanted to watch his next kill, what it will be, his development but he was just an alcoholic homo mess that was doing weird stuff... Waste of time unless you enjoy studying such crap.There are much better things to watch like real interviews with serial killers (Kuklinski) where you can see them and their real-life reactions or the lack of them/etc. This... just a cheap show that thrives on creepy stuff/kills and nothing else really...If you expect quality and complexity of Mindhunter/True Detective this is not it... Feels like a cheap slasher/creepy horror with dull story telling/ Or maybe the story telling is decent but his life was just booze and stalking/inviting his victims to have sex fantasies and to kill them.

It seems to be a little more about family problems, children, and possibly even relationships or lack there of. I find myself feeling bad for Jeff for the way he grew up and how hard it is for him not only being a gay man, but not having the confidence to get to know somebody and feel comfortable around them. But I feel so much worse for his father, who has tried his best to raise a good son, and even though he made mistakes that he didn't clearly mean to make, he still cared, and did everything he could for his son. I have a weird feeling that a lot of what is wrong with Jeff was due to his mom being overly prescribed out of variety of medication's. And it possibly just destroyed any potential of him having a good life. I could be wrong, but that's just what I've collected from it not the doubt it is a very good series and you can tell it definitely shows the perspective of everyone around Jeff not him personally even though you see what he kind of goes through and what he inflicts upon innocent individuals that he desperately never wants to leave."},{"id":"rw9400623","title":"Elite","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"27 October 2023","text":"Hands down the best thing I have ever watched on Netflix.

Presenting Dahmer's case in a thoroughly cohesive and provocative way. Jumping around the chronology of the events sheds light on many other controversies. Such as how he could get away with this for so long and his whole ambiguous reasoning for continuing on despite being acutely aware of what monster he had become.It is so curious to see through the internet the assertive cries of people who cannot understand why this series was made. The morbid fascination with serial killers and true crime in general isn't anything new. Be it pure fiction or based on true events, particularly here, it's the bellows of people who think Dahmer is being glorified and the victims' families are being lacerated by the sheer existence of this series, and we need to wait for the Ed Gein era for Dahmer where no one who was alive would give a damn and his entire profile becomes public domain folklore.The fact that a new piece of Dahmer media comes out every few years doesn't bother anyone. No, it's the fact that it's Netflix's biggest hit since Stranger Things; that's the issue people are at odds with. If it just flew under the floorboards, the thought of the victims cries would be much more subdued.

You then watch Dahlmer and you realize there are real monsters in the world and it's never too safe or too old to not take a drink from a stranger.Dahlmer series is very well directed and played by actors to the point that its disturbing. The racial injustice demonstrated by both the police and judiciary system also makes you feel angry at times about the system and people involved.Series is very well made so atleast you cannot complain that it was not done properly.

Dahmer was a serial killer in the recent past. Families of his victims are still around and almost definitely still haunted by the acts committed against their loved ones. Netflix does not care, creating fiction out of reality by stretching the facts and designing the story to fit their priorities. This showcases how far people are willing to go for a dollar in the current age and I wish it would've ended here, but the Avengers-like cameos from other serial killers can guarantee you that more will come. Judging this as a piece of media, the actors did a good job with the material given. The jumbled timeline eliminated all suspense and ruined a narrative journey that a story should tell, even though most are already familiar with the unfortunate tale.

A chilling look at the life of this notorious serial killer.The performances are expectational, especially PETERS, and a special mention for Richard Jenkins, who puts in one of the best performances I have ever seen in a mini-series.My only two criticisms surround the last few episodes that seem to focus more on the troubles and tribulations of Glenda rather than the sequence of events. She almost gets to the point of coming across a little sanctimonious, however horrendous her experiences clearly were.The court case (I know it was a guilty plea) was also covered in the space of 5 minutes, when I can imagine the emotion and drama of his crimes would have reached their peak.Overall a majestic portrayal, and one I will likely enjoy a third time in the future."},{"id":"rw9091602","title":"Dahmer","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"31 May 2023","text":"Dahmer is a new crime series that explores the life of the infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.The show is well-watched, but it lacks some aspects.The acting is pretty much good, with Evan Peters delivering a terrifying performance in the lead role.The series also showcases the psychological and emotional struggle that Dahmer went through, which is the interesting aspect of the series.However, the pace of the show can be slow at times, and some scenes feel repetitive.Additionally the series does not delve deep enough into the stories of the victims, which is a big missed opportunityOverall, Dahmer is a good crime series worth watching if you are interested in true crime stories.

A small criticism of the TV Series is the part of the screenplay in chapter 6: \"Silenced\", I could notice a small error in the script of the film, Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) was aware of not drugging Tony maybe because he was deaf or because felt \"empathy\". It is not congruent with the psychological profile of a true psychopath, because he lacks empathy, having supreme selfishness and neither does not care about the lives of others.

So with this special \"Netflix\" limited series \"Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" it was raw, blunt, and brash in it's showcase of one crazy real life monster in serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer(the wicked and good Evan Peters). The murder scenes are brutal and very blood like with nightmarish gore. Still along the way aside from the horror this series goes in depth and in detail about Jeff's troubled life and upbringing that lead him to be a monster, as shown are his being from a broken home, and his early love for road kill, which would all shape his different lifestyle on the Milwaukee streets which involved encounters at bars and bathhouses, after his exile from Ohio, and the military after his bored south Florida stay, in which Jeff passed some time working, staying with grandma, drinking beer and orange crush soda aside from his other strange hobbies. It's like a real life like bio of a serial killer, and you the viewer feel the pain of the victims families, and Jeff's father Lionel(the good Richard Jenkins) suffers the sorrow and heartbreak of what his grown son Jeffrey has become. Overall this was a tough brash series that grips your interest while you witness the difference of one Jeffrey and all while feeling the pain of the victims and their families."},{"id":"rw8968035","title":"Entertaining but partially a work of fiction","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"2 April 2023","text":"I admit that I've absolutely binged the show: it's extremely well done, with great acting and pacing (the use of flashbacks and the change of pov didn't bother me, I think it helped making the show more varied).However, I was fully conscious that I was watching a heavily fictionalised version of the story. The show is styled like a documentary but it's not, I think more viewers should be aware of it! Glenda's character specifically was really inaccurate, which I feel is very dishonest since she has so much space in the show.

This was a masterpiece,as expected from Ryan Murphy,from the music, atmosphere,acting,just perfection. Dahmer was a real monster, portrayed perfectly by Evan. What he did was absolutely evil,the scary part is that the real Dahmer seemed like a shy, introverted person that you could trust. Remember Scooby Doo? Those cartoons thought us that the real monsters are humans. Racism and homophobia is why he didn't get caught sooner ,I truly believe that. From all the movies,series about Dahmer this was the best,no doubt about that. It's defently something worth watching! Good job everyone."},{"id":"rw8944408","title":"A little part of all of us is Jeffrey Dahmer.","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"22 March 2023","text":"I was wondering where I was going to finally start this review but now I know: according to the trivia section this was written with one rule in mind: it was not going to be from Jeffrey's point of view.Dude...if that was your goal, you failed UTTERLY!This is totally from his point of view. In fact, it feels desperate to make him into the most sympathetic character on screen. Perhaps that's an exaggeration but that was a reason why it took me a while to get round to writing this. I wasn't going to watch it because everyone was talking about it but I had too many direct word of mouth recommendations to not.Watching this was an odyssey into myself, sort of like Lionel and his own book. I'm not quite sure why I kept making excuses for him. What I saw was a portrait of an individual who, at least at first, was the victim of a callous culture. A better culture than most the world but still intolerant of queer people and where parents either will not or cannot speak candidly with their children.As we see the very mundane (in the good way) journey of Dahmer into darkness, it is easy to relate to someone who didn't identify well with people (and vice versa) and didn't harmonize with people's strict expectations. His story is one of alienation. It began as a life where he had basically nothing to get excited or passionate about and ultimately was cursed with this one thing that made life more than one long bore.This is the impression I got from the show. Of course this Jeffrey and real Jeffrey are different people and I have indeed demarcated them in my mind. This is the not the 100% dramatized documentary like Schindler's List or Boys Don't Cry, this feels like just another TV show (albeit a good one). You never forget that it's based on fact which helps with the non-linear (and often meandering) narrative a lot.Prudently, this sort of begins at the (almost end). We all know there's no real happy ending coming so we get that out of the way and then get straight onto humanizing child-Dahmer.It is a poignant and bleak tale that (regrettably) isn't above getting a bit sentimental once in a while. It's admirable that they focus on how Jeffrey's crimes are not just his crimes but those of society. Not just through police misconduct but in the culture we leave. He is ultimately liable, I must admit, but considering he gets exactly the punitive measures he deserves, it is difficult to hate this Jeffrey. Like a hurricane that takes many lives and then dissipates the feeling is not anger but a sense of profound tragedy tinged with fear.Shot with a eerie yellow filter, you get right in Jeffrey's head as an appreciate of the sensual and intimate and as someone who craved connection but couldn't stand the rejection potential of a sentient human.It's a lot less interesting when we are following anyone who isn't jeff. There's almost no really sympathetic characters hear. The subplot about bad police is pertinent and relevant to the story but was not that interesting to me even though I am part of that \"don't trust the police\" choir.I thought his neighbour was kind of annoying and obnoxious. Clearly in the right but that's not the point.Anyway, it's not a horror, but it's worth seeing."},{"id":"rw8938539","title":"Very disturbing but exciting one!","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"19 March 2023","text":"Gave me nightmares for two straight nights while I watched the series. But I gotta say Peters is outstanding as Dahmer. Excellent and painfully realistic portrayal of a serial killer. The actor who did Lionel's role needs a special mention. He simply was a wormhole which I used to dive back into time and understand a father's conflicting emotions in such a situation. I would have been disappointed had this been a documentary because there are enough serial killer documentaries out there.The fictionalised real story of an infamous serial killer is what drew my attention to this.Caution: Those who are averse to violence, please stay away from this.

It would have been better in my view, to tell the story in a more linear way, episode 1-3 Dahmer as a kid-teen, then dahmer adult and the killing era ,then only one episode about the after ( prison time/ neigbour pain/ dahmer parents afterlife).But no, they had to gave us the Glenda show, do the point i have to ask, is she the real villain here ? She is stealing the pain of the families victims, she is acting like if she suffer as much as the families who lost a dear one ! WTF is wrong with her, Dahmer didnt kill your daughter, so stop being a drama queen. It was to the point my gf and I had to skip scenes with her, she tried to steal the spotlight and the pain. Also when I watch a TV show i want to be entertain, i dont Care about the families victim or worst about a neigbour. You can give them 20 minutes screen time thats it. I want to see the Monster Dahmer do his thing.In the end If you had to remember one episode, and I will advise you to watch only this one, its the one about the deaf man, this episode was great TV,\nOverall i give the show a 7.5/10, losing half a point for the crazy Glenda. Also losing points for the joke of a final, Christopher the guy who killed dahmer appear to be a hero here, like if we are supposed to thank him. When in reality he is not at all the decent man it appear to be, he is a bigger psychopath than dahmer and probably a more dangerous person."},{"id":"rw8921408","title":"Suffrage and Hatred Profiteering","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"12 March 2023","text":"This show is riddled with embellishments, inaccuracies, and a blended main character (Glenda).

While trying to fact check things such as the sandwich after eviction, Dahmer's father teaching him about roadkill, and several other head scratchers that I did not recall following the actual event and initial coverage, I was disappointed to find out these were fabricated or greatly exaggerated details.But at least the dad from Step Brothers and Molly Ringwald were in it."},{"id":"rw8889860","title":"I found it very slow for my pace at first.

You sympathise with the families, you get to know some of the victims and even feel awful at their deaths (one of them the most).All in all the show was very very slow and boring. But it's fine. I don't think this is one of those series that can be swept aside saying it's boring or even worse, revered because it's entertaining.This one had a more complex overview of the entire situation, instead of a monotonous investigation+chase feel that The Night Stalker has.I remember feeling effed up after The Night Stalker because... *Shrugs *\nHe wasn't human.But you connect with Jeff on a human level and understand his psyche here.

It was also hard to see how inept the cops were and how they must have been in real life to let it go on for as long as it did. The neighbor Glenda Cleveland also became a bit annoying for me.

He deserved what he got.As for the series, it did not do justice to the actual emotions that went with such a horrible crime spree. At the end it tried to glorify Dahmer as a changed man just because he accepted religion. His doing that was a way to escape from his prison life. He was only looking out for himself and never once felt sorry for what he did. Can't blame him cos he was an animal. But the series is also guilty of trying clean up his image.

I am always amazed at how little attention is paid if someone in America goes missing. Must be because its such a large country. He was a horrible person with little to redeem him in this portrayal of him. Too murder all those young men and still go to the same club to pick up another victim again and again. Really?

It starts with Dahmer's arrest and then is told in a series of flash backs and forward to some of the events in the story, some covered more than once from slightly different points of view. While I quite liked this some people may find it a little confusing.Where the series looses points for me is that there is too much padding and repetition in many of the episodes making them drag.

The acting is very good, we feel as if you are in the room with them. After that we have a complete repetition of already seen situations, everything starts to repeat itself and the series immediately loses its dynamics. Very quickly we learn about the classic difficult family problems that are mostly the basis of such people. Personality disorder, sexuality disorder, homosexuality are typical for serial killers, but I don't understand why 10 episodes of this?It is unpleasant to watch so many hours of this kind of content without any substance.

Cleveland did try to save a real victim of Dahmer's but in reality, occupied less than a footnote in the true story. This is all very well-known and has been elucidated in at least 4 other movies, almost all of which are better than this crappy Ryan Murphy dupli-series.Not all of it is abysmal. Richard Jenkins has Lionel Dahmer down to his facial tics and speech rhythms, and the other bigger name actors provide similarly strong support.But how could any of them --- especially Niecy Nash! --- go along with this rancid fictionalization? There are a few odd events that make it in here due to the long long running time but very few are completely accurate.Without more than a shred of truth, this becomes just a long morose Lifetime trash fire.If you're really interested in the horror show of Dahmer, watch \"The Jeffrey Dahmer Files\" --- an experimental documentary with the REAL neighbor, Pamela Bass. Or Jeremy Renner's early portrayal in the indie movie Dahmer (before he became famous). Both knock the crap out of this pablum.And Evan Peters really just sleepwalks through the title role here, providing no real insights. I think Netflix was terrified to portray Dahmer as anything but one-dimensional, so here we get Peters doing Martin Starr's Bill Haverchuck from Freaks and Geeks for ten episodes straight.

The interactions between Dahmer and his grandmother were comical at times, as were his interactions with other people.

Even before they exposed the sick people who became fans of him in the later episodes I wondered why I was watching this to begin. There's something wrong with giving all of this fame and glory to this evil lunatic. Unlike many others I've read in the reviews I didn't feel sympathy for him for one second. There are many individuals in this world with sick fantasies and poor upbringings who don't go on to do what he did.On the other hand I do think it is valuable to learn the history of these types of events as the show particularly did a good job highlighting the systemic flaws that allowed this flame to become a blazing forest fire. I did check the truth behind much of the series and it does do a good job in this respect as well.Overall, of any series I've ever watched this is definitely one that I couldn't and would never watch again.

As a massive fan of true crime I'm familiar with the story of Dahmer and my issue with the show is two fold.1. Despite the creators claiming the show does not put Dahmer as the focus and sympathetic link in the show, it absolutely does. At multiple points we are in a position to sympathize with him, his mother, his father and others in his life.2. Some of the incidents are dramatized unnecessarily, adding things they couldn't have known, and at point depicting the murders in ways that Dahmer himself didn't even describe them. Most aggregious perhaps being the episode with Tony Hughes (episode 6) where they depict Tony in a relationship with Dahmer before being murdered. They depict his murder as different to the known facts where the truth is much, much worse. I understand the desire for creative license and in making the show digestible to audiences.

Is as much an in-depth psychological examination of the prolific serial killer - his upbringing, his relationships, his desires and behaviors - as it is a graphic, unsparing, intimate, highly tense, and disturbing Netflix series. I feel disgusted, disturbed, intrigued, fascinated, and invested all at the same time. Much of the show's success is due to engrossing performances, particularly by Evan Peters in a disquieting turn as Jeff Dahmer and Richard Jenkins as his hard-ass father Lionel. Layer upon layer, the confounding character study unfolds by taking the viewer to different time periods in non-linear fashion throughout Jeff's life, setting the stage with his capture and interrogation. I only wish the pacing was a little faster sometimes, but the slow burn often increases the anxiety through anticipation and dread. The show also looks great capturing a retro and seedy atmosphere and the details of several locales from the 70s through the 90s. If you're fascinated by serial killer studies, then this is a must-watch, but if you are squeamish, then look away.

There are supposed to be at least two more series/seasons following the extreme success of 'Dahmer' although the subjects of subsequent seasons have yet to be revealed. The show stars Evan Peters as well known serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer as well as Richard Jenkins as his dad and Molly Ringwald as his stepmother. The series contains ten episodes that all were released at the same time which is the Netflix standard in September of 2022.This is nominally the story of the notorious life and violent death of Jeffery Dahmer who is one of the most famous serial killers in American history. The story starts with his apprehension in a rundown Milwaukee apartment in 1991 after one of his intended victims gets away from him and sends the police. Subsequently numerous gruesome and unsettling discoveries are made with regards to Dahmer. The show goes back and tracks Dahmer's early life and tries to piece together how he became what he became. He did not have a great family life, he was not very smart, he was not very social and developed a heavy drinking habit early on. We see all his failings leading to his first kill in Ohio and then years later as he fully embraces his dark nature and becomes a predator of gay minorities in Milwaukee. We see a few close calls as Dahmer comes precariously close to being caught on more then one occasion. Eventually though his luck runs out and he is marched off into infamy by police. It was good to see that there is time and attention given to at least some of the victims. Finally we are confronted with the death of Dahmer at the hands of an African American inmate which some may think of as a measure of poetic justice.I would never say that Dahmer was misunderstood. It is interesting, perhaps due to so many years passing, that the totality of his story is not fully grasped, or maybe hasn't been until now. I think for a lot of these high profile serial killers there are a few bullets that people know, but, for whatever reason, never learn the rest. I was a young teen when Dahmer was apprehended, and when he was subsequently killed in prison, but I don't think I had ever really gone through his story and that of his victims. I know there has been some controversy surrounding this show as the families have pushed back against this production that they see as dredging up negative memories and capitalizing on their pain. While I sympathize, to be fair, that is not a realistic way of looking at making popular media as then we would never get stories about the darker side of our human nature. A casual viewer may tune in to see a salacious expose of a notorious serial killer, and this show does do some of that to be sure, but what surprised me is how sympathetic it is towards the victims. There is a whole episode dedicated to one victim, a deaf man named Tony Hughes. Another victim highlighted prominently is that of 14-year old Konerak Sinthasomphone who actually managed to flee Dahmer and was handed back to him by police when Dahmer convinced them it was his drunk lover. A huge theme that develops in this show is that of race and how Dahmer was able to navigate a system that gave him, as a white man, the benefit of the doubt over and over again. Dahmer lived in a poorer Milwaukee neighborhood that was considered a \"bad\" part of town and was populated mostly by minorities. Most serial killers seem to be some level of intelligent as they continue to evade detection and hide their darker nature from family and friends. Jeffrey Dahmer is actually not very bright and it is through negligence, racism and sheer dumb luck that he eludes law enforcement as long as he did. Milwaukee is a notoriously racist city which is a battle that is still being fought decades later, and was an environment that Dahmer, the predatory monster, exploited. All this and more this show lays bare thanks to the creative team's deft hand as well as wonderful portrayals all around, most notably by Peters as Dahmer. This show elevates its notorious subject matter to a higher discussion platform rather than just being the latest glossy expose of the killer du jour. Creepy, haunting and meaningful Netflix's Dahmer makes for an enjoyable viewing some unexpected ways.Eric's Grade: A-"},{"id":"rw8737526","title":"That's a shame to admit that I watched it","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"15 December 2022","text":"One of the ugliest movie ever.

The numbers represent the order of the letters ACAB\n/ Ryan Murphy bevæger sig i LGBTQ+ miljøer i sine værker\n/ Dahmer bliver portrætteret meget humant, og det har i den grad pisset nogle af.

The series plays with that nicely, so that you have a clear idea that Tracy will die, and the same with the officers who appear when Tracy escapes. Nice move./ Ep 2 - We explore Dahmer's childhood and youth. Dahmer confesses everything to the police. Well played and tragic how both mother and father (unintentionally) help create the monster that is Dahmer./ Ep 3 - The show does an excellent job switching between timelines, and it expertly drops hints in each one. The narrative is made more fascinating by this seamless transition, which also feels necessary to the storyline. Jeff is a protagonist we can empathize with because he isn't portrayed as fundamentally evil. You can see why he is the way he is, and understand why he does the unspeakable things he does. However, there are no redeeming qualities about Dahmer's mother, even if someone claims otherwise. The episode also humanizes Dahmer, much like Episode 2 did. The series has also received a lot of flak for this.Ep 4 - Director Jennifer Lynch has directed a lot, also in the horror genre. But she hasn't been a regular part of anything. Fail - repeat - fail - repeat. The episode really shows that there was no way Dahmer could find a place in this world./ Ep 5 - Now the series starts to leak a little. The quality is sort of the same, but maybe 10 episodes is a bit too much actually. It's really starting to dawn on me that most of the people around Dahmer are so naive. They have been, and I can perhaps also understand why the family is, as it can be extremely difficult to believe that one's child/grandchild is as ill as he is. But the fact that neither the police nor the justice system works pisses me off extremely - should it go beyond the series - no - but if I have to watch it again and again, maybe it should be conveyed in a new way.Ep 6 We didn't really see Jeff as an antagonist all this time because he wasn't all that bad at his core and we couldn't really relate to the victims because we didn't understand their perspective. This episode skilfully shifts our interpretation in this regard, and it's fascinating to observe how the show accomplishes this without rushing things, by delaying it until the sixth episode, after making us develop a bit of sympathy towards Jeff. The episode also beautifully demonstrates Jeff's need for attachment, his capacity for unconventional love, and his fundamental desire for companionship. However, Jeff takes this need to remain connected to his victims way too far, even consuming the organs of his victims to keep some part of them with him permanently. Et kæmpe cadeau til Evan Peters, der virkelig har en svær rolle at formidle. Han rammer spot on som beskrevet ovenfor.Ep 7: The episode gives us a thorough understanding of the neighbor's point of view, which is quite insightful. We see everything she has experienced and how it has changed her. Additionally, it is upsetting to see how her voice is silenced solely due to her race./ Ep 8: Then we follow Lionel Dahmer, Jeffery's father, who does everything in his power to understand his son, and while he is initially determined that at least it's not his fault, he develops over the course of the episode to realize that Jeffery has half his genes after all. A character sheet that develops tremendously in this episode. Another 1-to-1 statement from one of the families, which was almost exactly what the statement of reality was./ Ep9: The episode tells a bit about how sick people are, something this series itself spins on, if you think about it a bit. The police are useless and are not critical of themselves. It says a lot about people too. Especially those who should be self-critical. Furthermore, the clammy ambient sounds in the score are obviously whale sounds/Ep 10: Dahmer's last living time. A form of ultimate justice was meted out by the prisoner Furly Mac (Christopher Scarver, and Dahmer's newfound arrogance is about to fall. The side plot with the killer clown Gacy is, for me, rather unnecessary."},{"id":"rw8719508","title":"Who would guess attractive blonde male serial killer","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"6 December 2022","text":"Dahmer possibly the most notorious serial killer of all time in my opinion.

The documentary on Netflix is much better in my opinion."},{"id":"rw8718565","title":"Well done miniseries with some glaring faults","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"5 December 2022","text":"Taken on its own without the historical context, this biopic of an extremely disturbed and destructive person is an excellent production. The acting, writing, direction, and cinematography are all top notch, and you can't ignore the skill and creativity that went into this.The problem, however, is we're watching the story of a man whose crimes affect still-living people, which should necessitate a higher standard of accuracy.I'm not one of those people who are triggered by anything that points out systemic racism, sexism, bigotry, or homophobia and start mindlessly screaming about some \"woke agenda\" like I've been personally attacked. Those conditions did help Jeffrey Dahmer get away with his crimes for much longer than would be possible if the victims and witnesses were of another demographic. There was little to no investigation of the men and boys who went missing, and the reasons for police inaction were inarguably the result of biased attitudes.That said, I found it extremely inappropriate that they chose to distill the experience of the black community into one character who is in fact a real person. Biopics regularly combine multiple individuals into one to represent a larger group. It's a standard way to limit the number of characters or emphasize a theme. It makes certain sense in this story to do that here, but the mistake they made was in mish-mashing real events with fictional ones and applying them all to one person.Glenda Cleveland is a real person who played a role in just one of the horrifying stories of Jeffrey Dahmer and the dereliction of law enforcement. To fictionalize the entire experience of the neighborhood and place it all on one still-living person is irresponsible and lazy. It undermines much of the truth of how race played a role by inserting racially tinged events that never took place. That doesn't serve to highlight those truths; it only invites claims of an agenda.The other very distasteful choice was inventing a romance between Dahmer and his victim Tony Hughes prior to his murder. Little is known about the connection between the two of them other than that some of Tony's friends say that they knew each other and may have slept together before. Dahmer referred to him as \"the deaf mute\", and didn't seem to have any sort of emotional attachment to him beyond coveting his body. It almost seemed like a means to stretch the story out and give some humanity to Dahmer, and that's a piss poor way to treat Tony Hughes' life and the family that still mournes him.Finally, the treatment of Dahmer's parents' stories kicks the feet out from under any semblance of credibility that the makers may have wanted. They quite clearly wanted an answer to \"why\", and their path to getting there was by inventing things out of whole cloth that could point to his parents. Did they play a role in what he turned out to be? Yes, of course. But you don't need to make things up to support that conclusion, nor would any regular child have become that depraved even in this fictionalized version of his upbringing. He and his father didn't bond over dissecting roadkill, so why pretend they did? What does that serve?The show has little faith in the audience's intelligence, and shows that by engaging in the sort of storytelling that hammers its point home with recognizable cliches rather than showing what really happened. The question of how nature and/or nurture created such a monster isn't answered, so let your audience reach their own conclusions based on the facts. The racial component of the story is complex. Don't simplify it because you think it makes the narrative stronger.Dahmer's victims were and are real-life human beings, so tell us their stories and try to be faithful to their legacies. There's just too much poetic injustice in manipulating their lives to serve Jeffrey Dahmer."},{"id":"rw8715604","title":"What's the purpose of this show?","starRating":"","datePosted":"4 December 2022","text":"If based on a true story, you would expect the show to be historically accurate, which it is not.It's almost a complete fiction, so if we take \"based on a true story\" out of the equation, what's so good there is left about this show?

If they're getting paid by the video frames I get it but imo they could have produced this in half or a third of the celluloid. Seriously, never thought serial killing could be boring until watching this. Mr Peters is great at his craft and the resemblance is there but this is a fairly one sided character in shallow waters. Most of it is boiler plate, \"sorry dad\" stuff. But most annoying is the ham fisted message that dahmer wasn't caught because he was white. Little mister privileged serial killer who could have been caught so many times if he'd just been born with a different colored skin. I guess the producers never heard of kermit gosnell. How did this guy manage to run his \"house of horrors\" for so long and never get caught except executive privilege. And the producers never sat on the jury I did. The case involved 2 young black men accused of passing bad checks at a bank. The one that actually committed the crime wasn't on trial, but rather turned up to testify for the state and the prosecutor made a point of stating over and over that this young black man came from a good family. His dad, a high ranking police officer and hs mother an administrator with social services. What's that word, 'privilege'. Again, the young black man on the witness stand is the one who committed the crime, and not the one facing the judge. The producers never sat on this jury or listened to 3 days of testimony as the prosecutor laid out the timeline. So what kind of defense did the young black man's attorney put on, who btw was also black. None, nada, nothing. No testimony, no rebuttal, no alternate theories. Just, \"your honor, I rest\". Then in summation when his attorney asked to borrow the multimedia materials the prosecutor put together, I was pretty much dumbfounded and sorry for the defendant but 30 mins to deliberate by a mostly white/brown/not black jury and another young man goes to jail; yeah I felt sorry for him but I also felt he was guilty. Not ironically, I was invited to exactly the same scenario many years later but fortunately I was able to be excused before I had send another black youth to prison. So while the producers might see everything in racial terms, from my personal experience, it's something else entirely. Otherwise how do you explain felony assault on live tv in front of millions of people and not a whiff of prosecution afterwards. And what's up with the guy who killed dahmer in prison. Maybe they should do season 2 all about him; bet it would be a lot more interesting.Also, molly ringwald, michael learned, love their work but man do I feel old now."},{"id":"rw8698946","title":"Disturbing","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"27 November 2022","text":"Evans Peter does a masterful job of portraying Jeffrey Dahmer. I was in my 20's when this story broke. Obviously, it did make national news, but not like it would today with the internet & social media. After watching this series, I still cannot believe this actually happened, but know it did. My heart breaks all over again for these families. I saw in some reviews that people took exception to the light being shown on the police force at that time. But, I think it was needed & deserved. I totally respect the police & I am extremely appreciative of the difficult job they do. However, there are bad apples...and it is no secret that there are underserved communities. Jeffrey Dahmer could & should have been stopped sooner. I read that some of the families feel victimized all over again.

But sometimes it's safer to stay on your side of the fence and mind your business, and that's the aggression this show captured. Sympathy for the victims, also fear and remorse.

Other than that, things started off fine but slowly went downhill with more and more of the usual propaganda we get nowadays. What I found particularly irritating is a majority of the final few episodes features more and more of the supposed woman neighbour of Dahmer going through a lot of emotional \"pain\" and trauma, but she wasn't even a victim nor had any of her family or friends killed by Dahmer. What is this.. some kind of vicarious victimhood? Why spend so much time on her rather than on the actual victims' families who suffered real loss?

This show is a special one, there is so much attention to detail! I've seen all the movies that have been released about Jeffrey Dahmer but none was as good, as accurate and as passionate as this show. Peters was absolutely convincing as Jeffrey Dahmer, giving some extraordinary performances. What you will see in the show is not a 100% accurate but most things are actually based on the real events, which makes the show much more intense, brutal, tragic and dramatic, sometimes you will get a horror vibe. This show is not for everyone, only adults who can stomach this kind of theme should watch it!While there is pretty much no gore in the show it still is very dark and many times it will make you feel sick, to me responsible for that is mostly Evan Peters and his performance but all the other actors do an amazing job as well. Many shows and movies have tried to get inside the head of a monster/psychopath but they fail. Well this show actually did it successfully! You will feel like you are inside Dahmer's head, you will be able to see the world the way he sees the world. Evan Peters proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. All the people involved did an amazing job. This is a definitely a show worth binge-watching. My rating is 8.5/10."},{"id":"rw8691757","title":"Great series....

I found myself extremely annoyed every time she appeared on screen because I have to watch her overacting and hear your obnoxious voice. It really ruined the second half of this show.I wish they would've just stuck with the real story because it was compelling enough without having to make stuff up. Overall, it's still a good show."},{"id":"rw8689922","title":"Heartbreaking, yet phenomenal","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"23 November 2022","text":"As a true-crime enthusiast for more than half of my life, I chose to distance myself from the Dahmer case until my early twenties, based on the disturbing nature of his murders. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I was also wary of how these murders strikes a nerve for others in this minority, which has led to additional means of irrational fear and excuses for intolerance by ignorant members of society.This season includes an impeccable ensemble of actors, and having only seen Evan Peters in supporting roles, I was unaware of his talent to master such a difficult role that few could likely replicate. Costar Niecy Nash, whom I've known only for her comedic roles in the past, also excelled as the unsung hero of the story.I disagree with the Rotten Tomatoes consensus (which I have continuously found to be heavily biased on many occasions over the last decade and has led to my reliance on IMDb for accurate reception) describing the program as \"glorifying\" one of the most notorious and dangerous murderers in the United States, as the sheer ferocity of his crimes and psychology are depicted in a fashion that would only make an audience uncomfortable with its sinister tones and peril. The argument of using shock value to appease serial killer fanatics and to create more publicity at the expense of the victims is not clearly applicable, as the violence depicted is not exaggerated noticeably from actual events, and there is no evidence of intentional glorification. The inclusion of events taking place prior to Dahmer's birth and upbringing is also in no way serving as justification or rationalization for his behavior, but serves as a means to provide a potential explanation to what led to his homicidal rampage. I will admit that the scene depicting a murder committed by John Wayne Gacy, obviously embellished to portray his clown alter-ego while torturing an adolescent victim, was not appropriate, and went completely against the consistent manner of realistically dramatizing Dahmer's actions.The one flaw of the series' portrayal of Dahmer that I do recognize is the decision to show a glimmer of remorse and a faintly sympathetic lens on the psychopathic killer.I also share concerns for the the families of the victims, understanding their outrage of the traumas they suffered returning to the public spotlight over thirty years later. Despite my belief that those involved with the writing and production were not seeking to directly earn a profit from the agony of these horrific losses, perhaps more attention to such backlash could have been dealt with more appropriately before the release of the debut season. As someone who has not personally gone through losing a close relative to violence, it is not my place to express whether or not the making of this series is justified.Although my reception of this season remains high, I will not likely rewatch it, at least in its entirety, based on the emotional heaviness that lingered long after finishing it. The decision to expand the program beyond a stand-alone miniseries has left me with a sense of uncertainty surrounding the heart-wrenching subject matter and the continuing quality of the series."},{"id":"rw8689538","title":"Probably the most realistic portrayal of a serial killer i've ever seen","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"22 November 2022","text":"Evan Peters has seriously outdone his job here.

And apart from him, the performances of the other cast members (His father, his mother, grandma, Glenda cleveland and the victims) were excellent too.Also, the cinematography and music was impressive. The writing and screenplay was decent too, especially the fact that they didn't did much creative liberties, and hence as a result, the story turned out to be close to the actual events. The only thing i found slightly disappointing was the length. The pace was a bit slow, especially in the last few episodes, and i feel the series could've been easily wrapped up in 8 episodes, instead of 10.But overall, it's a must watch. Especially for the ones who are interested in the crime thriller genre. It's a realistic take on one of the most notorious series killers in our history, where they haven't romanticized him and in fact, called out the ones who tend to do so.

It is shockingly accurate and does not spare its audience from the disturbing murders that happened. Evan Peters steals the show in this series and is the embodiment of Jeffrey Dahmer from his voice, mannerisms and acting. His portrayal is so accurate it is creepy and dark watching Jeffrey in action. From the first episode we are given a dark window into the life of this serial killer and it is beyond disturbed. The timeline and pacing is interesting, they start off with him getting caught and work backwards from that event. This works nicely. You feel sympathy and sadness for his victims but not Jeffrey, he is pure evil.My only criticisms would be I felt Netflix could have shortened this by an episode or two. The heart of the show was his awful deeds which then could have been wrapped up in 2 further episodes. So 8 episodes overall instead of dragging it out to 10. We didn't need to see an episode devoted to Glenda, they already gave her plenty of screen time. Overall not a bad series and I can see why it got so much attention. Disturbing, shocking but well acted. 7.5/10."},{"id":"rw8684026","title":"Could have been better","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"19 November 2022","text":"Here's an opinion from someone who barely knew anything about JD prior to watching the series.First, let's talk about the lengthy runtime:\nI feel the entire thing has been stretched out unnecessarily long, easily could have fit into 6-7 episodes. I personally skipped the entire \"Boogeyman\" episode, as it offered nothing of substance, but flashbacks and some forgetful dialog. Lots of going back and forth, at times I got extremely bored and just fast-forwarded a few minutes to skip the boring parts. And sadly, even after skipping good chunks of episodes, nothing of value was lost, I could keep up with whatever was going on on-screen afterwards.First few episodes are great, since they mostly focus on the psychology of Dahmer, his relationships with the victims, and of course, the killings. The show creates a disturbing atmosphere, and for that, I give them props. It was not an easy watch by no means. But it got me hooked on those first few episodes. Unfortunately, that appeal is lost later on in the episodes.Performance-wise, Evan did an amazing job as a confused, socially awkward psycho, props to him for delivering. However, I was inclined to watch some interviews featuring the real JD, and to my surprise, the guy was completely different from what is shown in this series? Extremely charismatic, outspoken man, nothing like the one we see in the show. From that moment onwards, I kinda lost respect for the show, since I knew that what I was watching, bore little resemblance to the real man.Also, can we talk about the annoying neighbour? As far as I understand, she is a fictitious character in the current form (she lived across the street?). I feel she was given WAY too much screen time, mostly rambling about \"oh how will I ever recover from this nightmare\" and such. Most of the time she was on-screen, I was inclined to look away, or simply skip the part, to get to the meat of the episode. Her presence was a complete miss in my opinion, and shouldn't have been anything but a side character.All in all, it's a watchable show, entertaining at times. Could have been way shorter if they cut some (a lot) of unnecessary scenes, to keep the story flowing nicely."},{"id":"rw8682070","title":"Into the Vortex","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"18 November 2022","text":"The opening scene is Dahmer (Evan Peters) getting arrested for the final time.

We see that even before he was born, his mother was on 26 prescriptions. His father would help him gather up roadkill for taxidermy. At 17 he was left alone by a divorce. His first victim was an accident. Like alcohol and cigarettes, Dahmer had an addictive nature.It was interesting to see him fly under the radar and escape justice for lack of evidence. We see police siding with him over a black woman. If Jeff was black and the complainer was white would it had happened the same way?

As incomprehensibly sick as Jeffrey Dahmer was, and twisted as the acts he performed were, this series is absolutely not some cheap slasher style shock flick. It follows elements of his life, his family, failures to recognize his depravity, the enormous pain he caused the victim's families and the community. In real life terms he had been a serial killer sicko to me that I dismissed. This series brings home the somewhat terrifying fact that he could be carrying out such perverse, loathsome acts yet walk among us on a day by day basis. The acting is totally superb throughout. I guess what surprised me the most is that through 9 episodes I only thought what a sick, depraved SOB he was, and then in the 10th and final episode, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. I mean, he gets what he deserved, I guess.

Seeing him play Jeffrey Dahmer was a completely new experience, and a completely different role to Tate Langdon, but I found it was THE role Evan was made for. I can't imagine how intense it must have been for him to act as Dahmer, knowing what he did and all the heartache he's caused. There's no one else better for the role. He deserves to win an emmy for this."},{"id":"rw8677586","title":"Chilling","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"16 November 2022","text":"Evan Peters smashed this role! His Midwest accent was spot on, not to mention his overall demeanor was spot on to Dahmer. This series did a great job of showing a peak into Dahmer's childhood. It all was very convincing and honestly pulled at my heartstrings at times. It makes \"My Friend Dahmer\" with Ross Lynch look silly. In my opinion, this is an excellent depiction at how the right actors and directing play such a crucial role in making a story convincing. I could follow along with the story and not be distracted by bad acting or prop use.The grungy dark scenes of Dahmer's apartment were chilling. I loved the pacing of the series, and it was exciting to follow."},{"id":"rw8676646","title":"Four and a Half/Five","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"15 November 2022","text":"Great story. Minus a point because it uses language that is very... 2022 for scenes that happened in 1991. Some of the detective stuff was retconned from real life. I also wish they'd actually included some of the necrophelia that Dahmer engaged in rather than just talking about it.Other than that, the story is accurate and engaging. The script seems to draw most heavily on the books Grilling Dahmer by Detective Patrick Kennedy and A Father's Story by Lionel Dahmer.In this light, it was more of a psychological/detective story than pure horror.People have criticized Netflix for releasing this series and not compensating the victims families. But it was a fascinating story worth telling."},{"id":"rw8676490","title":"Sickly story told brilliantly","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"15 November 2022","text":"The story of Jeffery Dahmer is gut wrenching and this series captures it so well. The actor, Evan Peters, plays Dahmer amazingly (it was scary how similar he was to the real monster), you can tell he put a lot of time and effort into practicing. This man definitely deserves many awards for this role! The first episode started off a bit slow and didn't grab me straight away however I persevered and from then on the story was too intriguing to give up watching. The series has an eerie ambience to it which is perfect for the story being told and it really encapsulates the horrific actions of the serial killer. If you love crime documentaries then this is one you should add to your list."},{"id":"rw8675494","title":"Who's to blame?

The very first episode could have been a neat little stand alone short film, but this is Netflix after all...We go from \"Jeff's\" (very rarely Jeffrey, we're not so formal with our new pal Jeff) arrest, to Jeff's past, where guess what? He was picked on and excluded, felt uncomfortable about his desires (because of his dad of course). Man I really feel bad for poor Jeff. Just look how he cries after killing that 18 year old boy, poor poor Jeff.That's the overwhelming theme of the series. It could be called Lionel Dahmer holds himself responsible for everything that Jeffrey Dahmer did, and we tend to agree.That's the main point. Jeff was a victim of his parents and society at large. The people he murdered were victims of the police. Great work Netflix."},{"id":"rw8674191","title":"This may be the greatest docuseries of all time","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"14 November 2022","text":"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (2022) is a series my wife and I finally finished last night. The 10 episode series focuses on everything about Dahmer - his childhood, his victims, his neighbors, his family, his murders and ultimately how everyone was impacted around him while he was doing what he was doing and after. The one aspect not covered, likely because of potential blow back from the government, was his behavior while in the military and what led to his discharge...which is also an awful tale.This series was created by Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy who also created Glee. The series stars Evan Peters (X-Men: Apocalypse), Richard Jenkins (Step Brothers), Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Niecy Nash (Reno 911) and Michael Learned (The Waltons).Everything about this series is perfect, especially the way it makes you feel gross with every scene. It's honestly hard to watch and get through. The acting by the entire cast is stupendous, but Evan Peters delivers an Oscar caliber performance. The details in the story telling is outstanding and you also get a good feel for his mindset and approach to everything he did. You get the feeling his family tried not to know what was happening also. It's a frustrating series to watch because it was obvious there were numerous times he could have been stopped. The ultimate resolution for both Dahmer and his victims are well concluded even if not fulfilling.Overall, this may be the greatest docuseries of all time. I'm excited to see what they do with the contract extension for three more series they got from Netflix. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."},{"id":"rw8672917","title":"Well acted","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"13 November 2022","text":"I had watched some interviews of DAHMER a few years back when I was on one of my YouTube content binge watching spree of many things good, bad and weird and so i knew most of the shocking stories surrounding him and so i thought this wouldn't be effectively shocking to me but my thoughts got contrasted harshly as apart from the first & last ep every single ep either made me uncomfortable,taking a liking to the supporting actors,their characters and performances, emotionally connecting to the victims and their families and to think constantly of Dahmer & the stuff he'd done, the motive behind it all, his upbringing and most importantly the negligence and the failure of the system\nthat i couldn't feel or do with just watching those interviews.Even if the series dramatasized heavily and used creative freedom to add in or omit out details and was innacurate on some events and dead right accurate on other stuffs it's still a well made anthology series when looking at in overall terms in my eyes and i only remember little details of it now as a whole(as usual) as I write this after watching the final ep so i ain't gonna rewatch to nitpick on stuffs.EVAN PETERS was perfectly casted.The persona, the attitude, the looks, the way even he smiled looked undeniably and wickedly similar to DAHMER.It was just that even if i liked his voice, dialogue delivery and all much..... DAHMER's voice felt extremely normal to me but PETERS felt very damn odd and non distinguishable from the serial killer and i loved it if i wasn't familiar with DAHMERS voice but other than that he did a terrific job.Anyways the rest of the cast memebers were extremely convincing as well and some of them made some of those characters memorable ones for me.Episode 6 definitely has to be the best as well as the most emotionally strong one in the series for me as it was well written, especially TONY HUGHE's character arc which was so damn effectively successful in evoking emotions.The end credit theme song felt to me both chilling as well as a little bit soothing too.I guess they are gonna be focusing on ED GEIN & GACY next considering how they slyly slid and neatly placed a piece of events(with GACY's lethal injection,DAHMER's baptism and the occurence of an eclipse all on the same day being something insanely coincident) including them in this series even if they both were a part of DAHMER's real life story."},{"id":"rw8671719","title":"Well made, but goes off the rails","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"13 November 2022","text":"The first 5 episodes are well-acted, interesting and engaging. Often difficult to watch, of course, due to the extreme sickness of the crimes, but still very well done.Starting around episode 5 or 6, it completely turns into yet another woke-O-rama, The big difference between this and all the others with the same agenda is the ridiculous, over-the-top, almost cartoonish caricaturing of an entire race/culture. Every member of this particular race/culture (save for one priest) is depicted as horrible, evil, selfish, arrogant, racist, corrupt, and just plain bad (yes, ALL of them). EVERY member of all other races/cultures are depicted as decent, moral, ethical, kind, caring, sensible, and just plain good (yes, ALL of them). The ONLY exception in the entire series was a priest, and possibly Lionel Dahmer and Chief Arreola (although he was depicted doing the right thing ONLY because of public pressure). I have no problem with showing the truth, warts and all, as that is very necessary to tell the whole story. It's just that it turned into a clumsy, almost laughably obvious attempt at depicting ALL people of one race/culture as evil. Even all the minor characters from this particular race/culture are slimeballs - according to Netflix.There's almost no other way to describe the last five or six episodes as anything other than racist propaganda."},{"id":"rw8668017","title":"Great writing and amazing performances","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"11 November 2022","text":"This show is excellent in telling the horrific true story of Dahmer and all of the lives and communities his crimes affected. The show also sheds a light on several important issues that contributed to the outcome. The acting is phenomenal and the show leaves you with a haunted feeling that lingers on inside you for many days after watching it. I really appreciate that the show focuses not only on Dahmer and his darkness, but also the people around him, including his family, neighbors and victims. The show managed to teach me about a lot of important things, such as who the victims were, police corruption and what red flags to look out for when it comes to individuals like Dahmer."},{"id":"rw8667459","title":"Fascinating, but inaccurate to satisfy an agenda","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"11 November 2022","text":"I found this show incredibly compelling, but I wasn't a fan of the fact that multiple elements of racism and corrupt police officers were present in the show, despite being inaccurate from real life. It's clear that Netflix was trying to satisfy an agenda, and I didn't like that, but I will say that I enjoyed watching the show. It's just that all the parts I found to be the most frustrating in terms of the police's actions all never happened or were significantly embellished-which I was bothered to find out later but ultimately not surprised that Netflix would add in those things to make the story seem worse than it really was."},{"id":"rw8666453","title":"The actors look like the people they play","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"10 November 2022","text":"What makes the series so good is that almost everything that happens in the series is true, 1 of the things that is not true is neighbor is 2 people in 1 character and they have chosen the perfect actors because they look so much like the people they play. The creators did not romanticize a psychopath like most series, but mainly focused on why he did it and its consequences. The emotion and the acting is just perfect. There really isn't much negative to say about it, just that the events of the last 2 episode are mostly fiction to fill up the ending a bit. For the people who do NOT like to see blood, this is recommended because you don't see the horrific murders happen, you hear it or they say the details."},{"id":"rw8666144","title":"Devastating.","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"10 November 2022","text":"I have never been a fan of Netflix content, but this time I must say that \"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" is an incredible production with a true story that continues to cause controversy. The script based on the already well-known true events of the \"Milwaukee Butcher\" is structured in a non-linear way in most of the episodes, taking us to the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's, to the different stages of life of its protagonist and his horrible crimes, plunging us into the question of what led him to do them, perhaps his relationship of abandonment with which he grew up? The emphasis on the lives of its victims and their families are quite well represented and lead you to be part of their suffering, to understand the anger and pain with which they fight/fought, in addition to the fact that social criticism remains the same more 30 years later: the incompetence of the police and their view that ignores still marginalized societies. The cast is well chosen, Evan Peters has made a name for himself playing maniacs, but this time he went much further and portrayed Jeff Dahmer as realistically as possible, Andrew Shaver gives an excellent dramatic performance as Lionel Dahmer and Niecy Nash as Glenda Cleveland demonstrates her great histrionic capacity, deserving to be more recognized her career as an actress, these three actors should definitely appear in the Emmy or Golden Globes nominations next year. It should be noted that it is good to see Molly Ringwald again in a quality production, offering a good performance, it should also be noted the performances of Michael Learned who is a tremendous actress and the actors Shaun J. Brown and Rodney Burford whose professional careers are promising. All the episodes are of tremendous quality, but it is worth noting the suspense used in the first episode, the cloudiness of the fourth and the highly dramatic sixth. Jennifer Lynch, Paris Barclay and Gregg Araki are three of the directors of the series, each with great careers and who translate their work into their respective episodes that each one directed. The costume design and the setting are the most noticeable, each decade is shown in an impeccable way. The soundtrack is an auditory delight, both the incidental music and the one that accompanies each decade. After all the charms of this series, it should be noted that Jeffrey Dahmer has not been romanticized, a realistic work has been carried out that shows how little society has changed in terms of its judicial system and the prejudices of those who make it up, this tells us it serves to remind us that the most gruesome history is the one that keeps repeating itself."},{"id":"rw8662098","title":"Dahmer's story or the neighbors?","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"8 November 2022","text":"Would have been great if it centered on Dahmer. Instead we get a large focus on Niecy Nash playing Glenda Cleveland whom I could care less about. Evan Peters shows his acting chops in this role. Every time he is on screen you cant help but focus solely on him. He was the best part of AHS and hopefully this will be his breakout role. I understand that Netflix wants to make this more about race and police relations in this post George Floyd world but this seemed to focus on the man and what caused and drove him to his fixations on murder. Tearing you away from that to some minor police room drama and the insufferable neighbor hinders that and takes away from the brutality of the story."},{"id":"rw8660876","title":"Unfortunately unnecessarily drawn out","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"7 November 2022","text":"The first few episodes were good and I really wanted to know what would happen next.

I hope for his sake that he will no longer be seen only in streaming series, but will also make it into feature films. He has what it takes!It's fun to see Evan Peters in the role of the serial killer, and the creators have more than nailed his look as well.The racist view of the police, who don't take the black neighbor seriously, as well as the relatives of the victims, because they were mainly black, Asian or Hispanic, is well portrayed."},{"id":"rw8659757","title":"Ultimately a Huge Let Down","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"6 November 2022","text":"Something happened along the way in this mimi series that saw it turn from facinating and inciteful to down right boring.It all hapened in the later episodes when the sign language guy enters.

And maybe he does, but nothing can justify the evil actions he chose to make. And the show does a decent job illustrating just how heinous his crimes actually were.It's pretty disturbing, especially for someone not used to seeing things like subjective cannibalism, true crime photos, and horrible reenactments that are highly sexualized on screen.It's interesting to learn the facts about Dahmer, albeit through a more stylized, produced semi-fictional portrayal. What is it about serial killers that we find fascinating? Maybe it's because they are able to do things beyond our own comprehension or capabilities. Maybe because like the song \"Vicarious\" by Tool, we live vicariously through the most evil and violent characters on TV because they can do the most atrocious acts that we can only imagine, without any consequences, because they are merely characters in a show, and they can get away acting out the most vile thoughts of our own collective imaginations, and we can sit and enjoy it without the fear of reaping any of the ramifications.Or maybe there's no deep explanation, and some of us viewers just find it fascinating.

A series of 4 to 5 episodes would have sufficed, the rest is just padding and lowers the overall quality. As is usual with these things, the Police get a sound kicking, and with hindsight (such a wonderful thing) should have done more.

There were some shortcuts in the story but I guess the screen time was limited somehow. I especially like that they showed some little situation from Jeff's life that weren't widely known. They also brought more attention to his father who is guilty in a way but was able to con everyone (including his son) that he isn't.

Credits to Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy for that. I binge watched it, like many others did before me. Everything is of top quality in this show, but the acting is what really stands out. Evan Peters just killed it playing Dahmer. He already did it once before in an American Horror Story episode, another hit from Ryan Murphy. He's perfect for this role and not only because his physique looked very similar to the real Dahmer. Niecy Nash was also outstanding playing the worried neighbour. Something different for her this time as comedies are normally more her thing. Richard Jenkins as the father was very convincing as well. Good directing from Jennifer Lynch, glad to see she's doing better things than her father David, well that's only my opinion. The story itself is one almost everyone heard about before, read the story or watched a movie or documentary about it. Of course the whole cannibalism touch to it is disgusting but that's not what disgusted me the most about the story, not even Jeff Dahmer himself. What I found profoundly chocking was the police (non)efforts to catch him, or better said the total ignoring of all facts presented to them. I guess a white boy doing his sick stuff in a mostly coloured neighbourhood, that's just a thing they are not interested in. The police could have prevented a lot of innocent people getting butchered, getting killed, and instead of doing something about that problem they even got rewarded as police officers of the year. What a scandal that is, only possible in America, you know, the land of freedom and opportunities, well that's if you're caucasian though...

It's kind of weird to write a review about the series knowing that this truly happened and the victims weren't just actors. They weren't just a role-play. They were real people with loving families, breathing, living, hoping. The main actor's acting was brilliant.. a disturbing person with a lot of external things from the way that he walks, he doesn't move his arms when he walks and talks and his appearance very close to the real one Dahmer... The others did a great job as well. Every episode makes me upset and leaves me feeling depressed due to the way in which a murder is carried out, or even just the downright creepiness surrounding the crime. I am pretty sure it is a descent show, and besides the creepy story it's one more step to eliminate racism. If this was the vibe of 80's and 90's about it, i am happy we are way better nowdays. About the series now episode 6 was a masterpiece i wish they had focus a little bit more to every victim's life the way they did with Tony Hughes. Also i am not fan of the 'now' and 'then' set up at movies or series so i 'd prefer the story was in the right order.. all this forward and backword was confusing.. but despite these two things the show was very good and kind of addictive 'till the end like a horror movie...i still cannot accept that it was all real... crimes happens too in my country too but i can't think of something that cruel..."},{"id":"rw8644024","title":"No good","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"29 October 2022","text":"As entertainment it was very slow and about 4 episodes too long.

The series covered the stories of the families that fought to find out what happened and also gave some more exposure to the fact that he wanted to know why he was the way he was.

He truly acted like a monster, his dialogue delivery carried a good weightage. The screenplay is too slow but the performance was outstanding makes this limited webseries swing between good and bad.

Hope the family can get more retributions that they might not have gotten. My deepest Condolence to the families.

At times I'd think \"While I was doing something fun somebody out there lost their life\"... The atmosphere immediately kicked those thoughts back into gear. The first episode truly was creepy, un-nerving and 'real'.. Hats off to Peters for taking on a role like this..\nAfter the episode finished I sat down and reviewed what was coming up..

His immersion in the character is evident and the layers to his performance are superb. If you also need any reminder (not that anyone should need it) that Richard Jenkins is one of the most versatile actors on screen today, your proof is here.My issue, however, is in the tempo and creative licence taken by the writers. Very similar to what happened in The Watcher, the very long, very drawn-out story simply doesn't follow a lot of the well-publicised timelines and movements of Dahmer, and instead paints him more as an unwilling participant in compulsive acts rather than the predatorial individual he was.Murphy's writing style obviously strikes a cord with many, but it's not without its frustrations."},{"id":"rw8636932","title":"More Netflix Lies","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"26 October 2022","text":"But, I'm not a believer in 1 star or 10 star ratings.

You know, something that effect. However, what we discover early on, is that it is a story that blatantly lies to you over and over, makes up it's own characters and events and how they happened and turns it into another Netflix Lifetime movie.

It finally went too far to where it was beyond me to even finish the show. This is what evil looks like.

That is disgusting. I watched two episodes with my family, it was horrible. I only understand the obsession with this type of stuff up to the point of trying to figure out how their minds worked. Anything beyond that is a complete mystery to me. But guess what, a production is not needed to find out how his mind worked, an article written, or a short documentary explaining these things would be far better. The point is to entertain? Who could be entertained by watching the recreation of a psychopath's killings? Someone who couldn't think: \"what if my child, my brother, my nephew, were murdered and their body brutally desecrated, and the person who did it gets a TV show made about them where the killing is recreated?\" And I heard in many of the reviews that certain parts of what happened were changed to make a political statement even though it alters facts, that makes it even worse if true.

Yeah, I'm being negative! So what? I've just lost way too much time to Netflix insanity to pack a punch. How did so many people take those so highly?!

Anyways, I literally had no idea who Dahmer was until watching this show so it was very educational and everyone should know about this stuff. This generation needs to know how horrible white people were back then, how bad racism was, how white cops acted, how horrible men behaved keeping their emotions hidden and how serious mental health can impact someone and everyone NEEDS MENTAL HELP. Dahmer knew what he did was wrong and he literally wanted to die because of it. God loves and forgives ALL, even those like Jeffery Dahmer.

It has great acting, a compelling story, great casting.But I don't understand why they insist on so many shows being shown out of order nowadays. This series would have been so much better if it was told in chronological order. Instead, it felt like they took a bunch of clips of the show, shuffled the order up, and showed them to you in a random order. It drove me absolutely crazy. It got to the point where I was constantly lost about where we were in the story's chronology, trying to piece together what happened when. And the first episode gave away the ending immediately, so instead of wondering how it would play out and where it was going the rest of the show was just like filling in gaps.I suspect so many shows are done this way now so that they can try to hook you with something really compelling by telling you the most interesting in the first episode. That way you don't start to watch it and give up.

Race baiting galore that adds nothing to the story except pushing modern day agenda in 1990s setting. I'm not downplaying the suffering of the victims and families but in my opinion the show could've benefited greatly from sticking to Dahmer.You never get to see his experiments, there's barely any gore or shock value, it feels very sterile and safe for a modern audience. Either write an original story or stick to the source material, but there's very little to be gained from making stuff up and throwing facts to the wind. Unless you had an alterior motive.Stop after episode 6."},{"id":"rw8633808","title":"Somethings feels wrong about this show...","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"24 October 2022","text":"This show just felt like another exploitation piece. The show creator and Evan Peters said in interviews that this is a story that will reflect the crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer through the perspective of his victims as to not humanise him or give light to his crimes.Well unfortunately that's exactly what they did... After the first episode Dahmer talks about his childhood growing up and the troubles he went through in adolescence all the way into adulthood. This lasts 4 episodes. Meanwhile learning nothing about the victims he kills in those episodes and now the show feels like a \"lets feel sorry for ol' Jeff\" type of show. It was honestly a bit of a drag after a while and I was left thinking why we weren't spending more time with the victims (like we were told we would).Then episode 6 starts the first 20-25 minutes or so on just one of Dahmers victims (Tony Hughes) and shows how he eventually winds up meeting Dahmer which is a good start. But then the story claims this Hughes and Dahmer get into a relationship, before he inevitably kills him. If you do just a little bit of research into this aspect of the case, you'll find that there is very little evidence that Hughes did get into a relationship with Jeffrey Dahmer. It ruined what was a good start to the episode with this romantisized version of events, which the victims family finds obviously offensive.Speaking of the real families, none of the families were contacted or asked to be involved in this show and many have voiced their opposition to their on-screen portrayols when they weren't asked to be involved with the project to begin with. Makes you wonder if they were really trying to make a show from the perspective of the victims eh?The remaining episodes focus on key characters from the victims side and Dahmer's family which the whole show should have been about. Instead half the show is just 4 hours worth of humanizing Jeffrey Dahmer childhood storylines. But even the last half of the show which is better than the first half just feels wrong, due to the fact that the whole show at that point felt exploitative and I know nothing about most of Dahmers victims that the families are in court to bereave.This doesn't mean that real life serial killers shouldn't be portrayed on screen and it has been done and done well (Mindhunter for example). This doesn't mean that there can't be a Jeffrey Dahmer movie or show and doesn't even mean that you can't dissect the minds of people like that, because you can and again it has been done before... just much better in other media."},{"id":"rw8633716","title":"A Good Balance","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"24 October 2022","text":"Seeing as though one of the casts most crucial rules was to make sure not to tell the story from Dahmer's perspective, I think they did well.Typically with movies/shows that follow the protagonist (or antagonist in this case), we tend to attach to the main character and try to relate or sympathize but I was completely unable to in this series. This is the first time I've ever been able to not relate, sympathize, or give a hoot or a hollar about the character that's being followed in the story.I have a lot of respect for Even Peters and all of the other folks who played as the victims and the victims families. It's difficult telling a huge and popular story, especially one so grim and controversial and not having millions of people raising a metaphorical pitchfork at you."},{"id":"rw8631500","title":"Well-acted and thoughtful but Nash was a bad choice","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"23 October 2022","text":"With a degree in psychology, I've studied cases like Dahmer's and seen many of the docs offered. My first reaction is this series wants to focus on all the minutia from the first nflx doc where they interviewed the paralegal who recorded all those audio tapes. It follows it pretty closely and actually is not as gruesome, focusing more on the interaction with the victims. I hope they paid Peters a very high salary for not only accepting this role but for his amazing performance.I feel the film focuses too much on some details that we can ascertain in 45 seconds instead of 3 min. But that's part of the new normal in psychological drama.My biggest complaint is the extreme focus on Glenda and the unfortunate use of Nash, who comes off as a comedian no matter what the character she plays.I noticed a lot of reviews claim it turns into libiberal fest (can't use tribigerber words here anymore). But having lived in that time -- in fact being born the same year as Dhamer -- I can say this depicts true situations. I've seen a lot of feedback on films claiming they insert things when really it's just depicting the times. Especially since this is a true story, it is depicting actual events that were, unfortunately, much more common than just this situation.A psych student states that Dahmer was ill, not evil and I have to strongly disagree that there's any difference. It's common for those studying human psychology to mix up the fact that one deserves compassion with the idea that they were not intentionally evil. Law enforcement and the courts do make the differentiation of whether one understood their actions were illegal, and that definition is not a psychological definition, that's true. We can recognize that Hitler, Stalin, and Bin Laden were just humans struggling with some physical or environmental deficiencies or imposed beliefs but the acts they committed were still evil; whether in the psychological or biblical sense could be up for debate.And speaking of environmental, Dahmer's environment is not what caused this. Many kids grow up shooting and skinning animals and they don't kill people. But many children do have enormous emotional and psychological trauma from neglect by a parent. Severe abuse includes neglect/lack of bonding or touching and causes a child to withdraw and numb while still craving human interaction. These are the ingredients for a psychopath. Less than 2% of psychopaths become serial killers. Some believe diet can actually help but that's probably 20 years out when society understands the effects of food on self-control and mood/behavior.Overall a good watch but did fall off the rails the last few episodes like there was a different writer; way too much focus on Glenda with borderline comical acting from Nash. This may be why some viewers feel there was a bent toward focusing on the lack of response from the LE. But in fairness, Glenda did continuously try to get someone over to investigate.Peters and all the victims were amazing. I can't imagine trying to play these parts."},{"id":"rw8631032","title":"Started off well then became a mess","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"23 October 2022","text":"Started off well, well directed and interesting portrayal in the first 5 or 6 episodes then it became this tropey historically inaccurate overly dramatised mess.

Full of pointless scenes that never actually happened e.g the sandwich scene, never happened in fact Jeff's neighbor is a composite of two people. Why can't they just tell it like it happened, Jeff was a terrible murderer no doubt. I don't need it garnished with unnecessary flourish!

Stunning. Production design and acting were very good. I knew about Dahmer, but he was someone I didn't research. What they did were very bad and terrible. In the last parts of the series, they brought the subject to unnecessary topics, but there was no need. As always, when someone like him occurred, first of all, their childhood and relationships with their parents are discussed, which I think was a very valid issue. What can we say about Dahmer? What they did was very bad and terrible. Of course, there would be some people who admired him. It intrigued me, but I'm not a fan of course. When the trailer of the series came out, it caught my attention and I added it to my watch list. But I didn't expect the series to be watched this much. For some reason, I lose my interest when it comes to a series or movie that suddenly became famous and watched a lot like Squid Game. So I waited a bit and passed it on.

Obviously because of the chilling true story behind it, but also because of the way the show is build up. It truly explores the life of Dahmer where the main focus is not on the gruesome killings themselves (most of it isn't even shown!) but the story behind it and how someone could get that sick and twisted to do these things. Because of this build up the show can be slow at times. I myself quite frequently found myself wandering of and sometimes even turning it off halfway through an episode. But it keeps drawing you back, wanting to know more. This is also because of the brilliant and oh so subtle acting of Evan Peters. It is a real shame though that Netflix/the producers didn't take the effort to include families involved in the actual story first.

There is a ton about this show to like. It was very well made. Phenomenal acting. Disturbing atmosphere. I really DID enjoy it quite a bit. I would recommend it.But it goes off the rails exactly halfway through. Up to episode 5, I was hooked. Starting with the 6th it got progressively boring and slow. They threw a whole episode away on the deaf guy and it somehow became the Niecy Nash show.On top of that, they totally rewrote things to give them some kind of political or social justice edge. Exaggerations to flat out fabrications.Don't treat this as a documentary in any way. It's WILDLY inaccurate. They basically took the real people/places and tossed them into a sandbox to arrange them how they wanted but much of it is wrong. When you see the little asterisk with *based on true events* take them at their word... lightly \"based on\" with ridiculous liberties. I have to deduct major points for that, especially with how they tried to spin it.And I wish they would have focused more on the killings but they kind of glossed over it while making it minimally gory. Much is implied but not shown. I'm not a fan of that style when it comes to horror or crime.One thing I want to say that they did amazingly well, and I don't know if it was even on purpose, was the portrayal of Jeffrey's feelings and struggles with a personality disorder. I was diagnosed in my early 20's with the same thing as Dahmer, Borderline Personality Disorder. In this show he expressed constant and chronic feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and despair which led him to self-destructive behaviors and habits. They really got that right. I felt what Dahmer felt.

This is too low and of course this cruel killer should not be whitewashed.I have no questions about Peters at all, he brilliantly played those moments when the authors failed, he carried everything on himself. Overall, the cast performed at a high level, even in those scenes that were either unnecessary or downright weak.It cannot be called a masterpiece.

I love that they didnt pick sides (except for the times when the other side was black), they just told the story from an observer's perspective; they didnt try too hard to make us hate this character. I respect that.I couldnt help but check graphic images related to this case while i was watching these series. I've had pictures of these victims in the next tab, pictures of his apartment and of course the polaroid pics and I must say Netflix made the most realistic adaptation ever! His actual apartment looked exactly the same, I couldnt tell apart his actual father from the actor.There were times they changed the script to make things more dramatic though. Like the way Dahmer murdered Tony and the way he tried to make him a zombie by drilling his skull.The only character that seemed too much was Glenda. This character was too extra when you consider that the actual Glenda let alone being neighbors with him and getting offered sandwiches from him, didnt even know Dahmer personally. They wanted to give moral lessons through this character, they wanted to show us the unseen minorities i know. But there were times when the Black investigator and Glenda seemed very unnatural, cartonized and victimized.Its like Netflix made the best soup ever but when it was time to serve it, they were reminded to \"spice it up\" with moral lessons and ended up making the soup too salty. My point is that the moral lessons were so out of the place that it seemed unnatural and it was like they added these extra lines later because whenever the black investigator made a remark in regards of minorities, there was an awkward silence and no response at all. I didnt like the atmosphere they tried to create there.I know there was police ignorance and most of the times Dahmer could get away with murder just because he was a white blonde male and his victims were people of color. There were injustice. But cartonizing characters in order to make your point is never a good idea because by the end of the series I couldnt help but feel like i was watching a poorly made propaganda."},{"id":"rw8630328","title":"Fantastic portrayal of Dahmer that goes off the rails in the final episodes","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"23 October 2022","text":"Not enough praise can be heaped on the leading cast. Evan Peters gives an unsettling and nuanced performance, and Richard Jenkins blows it out of the water as a horrified yet still devoted father. I could go on for paragraphs about the strength of the main characters in this show, in both portrayal and script. Although some of the victims' families take offense to this show existing, it is unfortunately part of the territory when you're attached to shocking events, and I felt this show was more respectful than most serial killer fare. Never does it stoop to exploitation or cheap shocks (many of the more gruesome details of Dahmer's crimes are omitted), and care is taken to portray the victims as real people with lives and families. Dahmer himself is not one-dimensional, but neither is he really sympathetic. The show avoids trying to explain why he is the way he is, which I really appreciated.It is to be expected that liberties will be taken with these real events to condense things, provide better pacing, etc. Most of the changes I thought were fine. Where things began to kind of go off the rails was around episode 6 or 7. After Dahmer's arrest, the show begins to focus heavily on the court proceedings, race relations, and the domestic drama of the grieving families, the latter two delving into straight fiction. At the risk of sounding callous, I found it boring. I don't care that a victim's mother took umbrage at a tasteless comic starring Dahmer and mounted a lawsuit. Dahmer was a killer of opportunity and did not go out of his way to kill minorities, nor did he specifically choose a minority neighborhood to live in. The police did not ignore tips/warning signs about Dahmer because the neighborhood was mostly black, but because of homophobia (an actual issue the show could have explored more). I do not believe cops were making racist crank calls to victims' families, and the man who killed Dahmer was a raving lunatic who murdered someone for $15, not the righteous hand of justice.Would have been an 8/10 or 9/10 without the drop in accuracy and quality post-episode 7. Still worth a watch if you enjoy this sort of thing."},{"id":"rw8630163","title":"extremely long but the script is way superficial.","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"23 October 2022","text":"Not sure why it's getting high reviews.The script is very simply about the main character, but the length is unnecessarily long. Lots of repetitive scenes, covers lots of trivial but doesn't help building the main character at all, which only makes the story messy and unfocused. E.g. They spend half of the episode on a victim's background / life, perhaps wanting the audience to feel empathy for him, but it's pointless for the story. (cutting out those parts doesn't make any difference, it's not like how the victim is / their life is, makes a difference in why or how Jeffery's decision to take their life. It becomes incredibly boring at some point.The actor is the reason for the stars."},{"id":"rw8629383","title":"do your research before watching this show","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"22 October 2022","text":"If you actually know the full, true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, much of this show is infuriating. It is riddled with inaccuracies and over dramatization. However, it's wise to keep in mind that this isn't a documentary on Dahmer, it's a TV show, so excess and ridiculous drama is expected. The show overall is pretty good, but surprisingly SO slow. Each episode lasted an eternity and was wayyyy too drawn out. I understand this is how shows make their money, but it's rough as a viewer. I was also expecting much more gore and violence. There's next to none. Almost all graphic content is described by other people in the episodes, not actually seen. I really dislike how the show is pieced together as well. The first episode starts with Dahmer being arrested, and we backtrack from there, spring forward, backtrack, spring forward, etc. It seems like a really strange way to tell a story like this. It makes it more confusing than it already is. The timeline they actually lay out for Dahmer's life is wack. Finally, the involvement of basically everyone involved is super exaggerated, but this is how they make the story more compelling I guess. They also make this story 1000x more racially charged than it actually was. However, I was definitely expecting that. My biggest piece of advice before watching Dahmer is to do your research. There's a short documentary on Peacock called \"Dahmer on Dahmer\" that I highly recommend watching FIRST. Even simply reading Jeffrey Dahmer's Wikipedia was incredibly informative and it gives you a knowledge base for this show. The show itself is decently entertaining, but all viewers should keep in mind that this portrayal is not at all accurate. The ratio of accuracies to inaccuracies are 1:10, seriously. It's almost like the writers took the story of Dahmer as a template and made up 5 other storylines and mashed them all together to make a show that is kinda about Dahmer, but really not. It's so weird and annoying.I'm giving this show a six because the acting is top tier, especially by Evan Peters. He absolutely nailed the character of Jeffrey Dahmer. Unbelievable acting all around."},{"id":"rw8628645","title":"Interesting series with a lot of inaccuracies","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"22 October 2022","text":"First off, I am an Evan Peters fan. I think he's a terrific actor but I don't really feel like his portrayal of Dahmer was all that great. One of the scariest things about Dahmer was how intelligently and articulately he described his own crimes. The real Dahmer was soft-spoken, but self-aware and charismatic enough to manipulate people but Evan Peters portrayed him as completely monotone and emotionally flatlined. Maybe that's what people expect of someone who's done these kinds of crimes, but it wasn't how he actually was. There are many online interviews where you can see for yourself. I'm sure it was a difficult role, but I feel like EP missed the mark and just played him as a generically non-emotive psycho.There are also a lot of inaccuracies; many other reviewers have listed them here so I won't bother repeating, but there was a definite narrative being presented that diverged from facts. The real story was intriguing and certainly horrifying enough to not have to make stuff up or editorialize it to a particular opinion, but that's Hollywood for you.All in all it was worth a watch, especially the first half where the inaccuracies were kept to the minimum and the history of JD's life is presented as events actually unfolded. There's a lot of time jumps that could be confusing if you aren't familiar with his story but that didn't really ruin it for me. What did ruin it were the later episodes where entire episodes are based on fabricated characters and events that are used to \"sell\" a particular narrative. Still it's the best and most detailed look at Dahmer and the horrible, shocking crimes he committed."},{"id":"rw8628223","title":"4 episodes squeezed into 10","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"22 October 2022","text":"Meets somebody,kills them then cuts them up while neighbours complain about the smell.

Fine performance by the guy who plays his father.Could have been wrapped up inside 4hours. Definitely no Mindhunter.

I personally found Evan Peters' performance good but annoying. I am not familiar with Dahmer's true voice and mannerisms and I would assume Peters studied them. If so, Dahmers himself had some very annoying voice and accent ticks, and perhaps Peters is just doing the best he can. Niecy Nash's performance as Dahmer's persistent neighbour is stellar. She deserves a SAG or an Emmy for her amazing portrayal. Her scene with Jesse Jackson is particularly poignant and impactful.Ryan Murphy's take on the life of Dahmer May not be everybody's cup of tea, but such a topic unfortunately cannot be glossed over."},{"id":"rw8624813","title":"It is well made but horrifying","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"20 October 2022","text":"I gave a 10 out of a 10 because they did a good job production wise, telling the story but it is horrible. What I get out of it is that, there is still a lot of racism in the USA even after all these years. Even though his motive wasn´t discrimination, I mean by the police and the justice system. We can still see it today and it is not okay. If anything I hope this helps send this message and fix it but I doubt it will happen. As we have seen similar cases still in the 2000s, many years later. Also it is horrible to relive all these events, I hope they dont make anymore of these real stories and just do fiction for the sake of the victims´ families."},{"id":"rw8624574","title":"So good!","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"20 October 2022","text":"I'm not normally a fan of shows/film that rely on jumping around a timeline, but it works well for this mini-series.

I appreciated the victims points of view, and now have so much more knowledge of their tragic situations. I understand where other reviewers are coming from in that I do believe it humanizes Dahmer, but I don't personally have an issue with that.I think the show runners did a great job of retelling stories from unique perspectives, because let's be honest, Dahmer has been over produced."},{"id":"rw8623060","title":"Put some praise on Richard Jenkins!","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"19 October 2022","text":"A fabulous tragedy. This series turns the inside's out, literally... You might feel disgust, disbelief, and perhaps sick. Angry, sad, or sorry for Jeffrey. - Whatever you feel is not wrong.I recommend taking some time off and watching something else when it gets tough. I myself usually binge shows, but with this - for me it wasn't possible.That being said, it is a beautiful telling of a real and gruesome serial killer - his unspeakable actions and its repercussions. The Dahmer family, the victims families, the police, every angle is tackled masterfully.Excellent camera work, especially the absurd close-close ups that makes you feel trapped in the room with Jeff. It really gets under your skin...Lastly, perfect casting! The writing is d*mn good, so ofcourse that helps (Worth noting: some of it is actual words spoken during the real events). But, Evan Peters as Jeffrey Dahmer gets the mannerisms and body movement just right. And it is astonishing with the way he manages to get the tone of Jeff's voice heard on interviews spot on. He's balancing on a razor blade and he's locked in! His performance have been covered widely, but i couldn't help mentioning it.Lastly x2: With the title of this review i wanted to give credit to Richard Jenkins! His scenes towards the end really got to me.

I have seen Evan act before in X-Men, Kickass, AHS and some more productions, but this one is a performence of a lifetime if you ask me. I have also studied Dahmer before, as I am fascinated by forensic psychology. You can feel the amount of hard work that was put into perfecting the performance and you can feel it in every scene, every line and in every breath that Peters takes. No other show had ever had that much of an impact on me while watching it. It took me about 3 hours to recover from episode 4. The nausea, fear and depression that it had brought onto me was mind-blowing and a bit overwhelming. I had believed that I was immune to such content, having seen and read so many things about serial killers already, but this show has to be an exception.I don't think that it is something you can watch purely for entertainment. It tells a true story and the people who have lived it are still alive. It is serious food for thought as it proceeds to show many problems that still can be seen in society. It explains what could have contributed to Dahmer becoming a killer, but in a way that doesn't let him off the hook. Even despite his early years triggering some sympathy, at least in me. However, it does portray his victims as more than just his victims. They are shown as people who are to this day loved dearly and missed and who did not deserved to be killed.Loved it, especially the 6th episode. The acting is on point, kudos to the guy playing Tony. The Jefferey Dahmer story is honestly a masterpiece, but only for people who are mature enough to draw the appropriate conclusions.

Just a story about a serial killer, who is not a smart one, just a lucky one. He didn't get caught not because he was smart, cautious, just because it's too easy for him, the whole policy office system was helping him, even after he died.The justice didn't get clarified as they told. That's the spark of this story, while Glenda was getting her award in a little room, the two racist policemen were cheering in a ceremony.

The series bounces around exploring Dahmer's life as a young man, his serial killer years and then his life in prison, it also focuses onThe first thing that irks me about the series is that it skirts around the more horrific, gory details. That in itself isn't a bad thing but it means that you don't really get the feeling for what a monster Dahmer was and as such there are times you almost start feeling bad for him, the lack of horrific detail also means it can get quite repetitive with each case almost identical. He goes to a club, picks up generally a gay black individual and drugs them (it's then just implied that the person is killed and disposed of).The second thing is that it feels very slow paced and drawn out with lots of scenes largely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The episode featuring Tony (Silenced) was excellent it gives you a feel for the victim beforehand, as you get to see his life and build a connection before he is eventually introduced to Dahmer and the inevitable happens but the following episode focusing on his neighbour (Cassandra) feels very repetitive and unnecessary, in the opening episode we see her shouting and screaming at the police that she has been warning them for ages about Jeff, this is enough to set the scenario and having multiple scenes about her complaining about the smell and the noise just feels excessive (as a viewer, we get it).

He stopped doing these things for a time but then he started again (worse). The only person he ever really reached out to for help was his father. But he could not confide in anyone about what he was thinking, planning, doing... until he was caught and arrested. Then, he wanted to tell everything.When he was tempted, he could not resist.I think he became sincerely sorry in the end and realized how awful and evil he had chosen to become.

I happened to see this trending on Netflix and decided to watch. First 10 minutes and I had already switched it off, not wanting to see anything gruesome. I then started reading about Jeffrey Dahmer and was shocked to read about the gruesome murders he committed. Also I was curious as why he did it! I mustered up my courage after a few days and started watching again. I already knew the story by then, but watched the entire series mainly for Evan Peter's brilliant portrayal. He was frightening and at the same time showed calmness in his role. The last 3 episodes were not as gripping and not so accurate as well. There was too much emphasis on Glenda Cleveland which felt too repetitive. The series did not appear to have gruesome scenes as I thought would had been. Most of it is implied. However the facts that this was all real gave me the goosebumps. It in fact made me realize that you cannot just get in someone's apartment without really knowing them. It in fact is an eye opener, that humans can be evil for no rhyme or reason. I do feel really sorry for all the victims and families that are reliving this nightmare and probably can still not come to terms with the horrific incidents.

The show was good until there. It is disappointing that show runners always feel like they have to invent stuff to pump it bigger, by creating a fictional female character that never existed in the real events. Great acting but not accurate. Also when you just watch the interviews with Dahmer that exist on YouTube, you'll see that he is not talking the way he is portrayed. But it is in general still better as I expected, since I find it weird anyway to make films and shows about such horrific things.

The tone is completely off. They've written this show like a horror movie which is too good of a treatment for a villain like Jeffrey Dahmer. Jeffrey Dahmer doesn't deserve a TV show. His work doesn't deserve to be glamorized and showcased for a wide audience.I think this would've been better as a documentary subject where we can give victims and families a voice rather than dramatizing them on screen and also where we could extract broader meaning to what his killings meant and what we cab learn.I'm not trying to make a moral argument against true crime material. I've consumed as much as anyone, but certain subjects are only properly treated in a specific medium and I don't think TV miniseries is right for Dahmer.

The first few episodes really made me uncomfortable. I didn't know most of the details they showed in the series, so it was shocking to see what Dahmer really did throughout his life. My heart goes out to the innocent victims families, it is really disappointing that people have made this series a joke. There should be no jokes made about what Jeffrey did to these young men. It is dehumanizing and disgusting to do so. I am confused as to why they put Glenda Cleveland's apartment right next to Jeffrey's, when that was not where she lived. I don't know why Netflix decided to include false details about the story. Seeing the police bring Konerak stuck with me watching the rest of the series. How clueless can 2 police officers be? He was an innocent child. What's not included in the series like most, Tracy Edwards who escaped Dahmer's apartment and got him arrested, has been in prison multiple times for many reasons including murder. It is interesting how he almost got murdered by Jeff, and then testified against him but later on murdered someone else. Overall, I believe this series was good. Evan and Niecy's performances were outstanding. I don't know why people are fixated on continuing the entertainment of Dahmer's terrible actions, but it was okay.

No need to do that. Just tell the story accurately, so someone can watch this ten years from now and this would still feel relevant.I'm not sure why Netflix can't just produce a historically accurate series.

'Dahmer' provides an intriguing perspective into a killer's crooked mentality, it sheds some light on his corrupted senses of what might be wrong and what might be right!Albeit the same parameters of judgment often got flooded with contradictory notions and a lack of respect and sympathy towards all the victims and their families. I noticed many had already spoken against the glorifying aspects of this particular portrayal and how it tries to instill empathy for the wrongdoer and I hereby raise my voice as well.You shouldn't at any expense glorify a vicious criminal like Jeffrey L. Dahmer. Yes, you can create Documentaries all you want; matter of fact, you should show us what exactly made him an aberration, inform other parents about the red flags, about the 'signs' they should be looking for in their children and their recurrent misdemeanors. But don't try to romanticize this stuff, trust me when I say this, there will be consequences beyond your control.P. S.

I guess I will start with saying how sorry I am for the family's that may be impacted and how horrific this must of been for them. The acting is incredible, outstanding and brilliant. They all should receive awards! It is crazy to think of how many victims could of have been saved if individuals have done their jobs throughly. I feel for everyone that was involved, and hope we can learn what not to do/ or can do if something ever were to happen/reported. If you are easily scared or bothered you shouldn't watch this. In the first episode I just kept thinking how horrible it would feel to be stuck/trapped."},{"id":"rw8616388","title":"Mixed feelings","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"I have very mixed feelings about this series. The story is horrible and what Jeffrey Dahmer did is haunting me a little bit, but the series is very well put together. The acting is really good and the order of how the story is told is also really good. Also I found that the amount of stuff that was really shown wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Yet I got very nauseous throughout the series, because of story itself. If you want to finish the series you'll just have to get over that. I didn't really get nightmares from this series, but I do listen differently to the sounds that come from my neighbors."},{"id":"rw8616272","title":"Not enough people are talking about Niecy Nash","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"I think this show does what more of these docs should: painting the subject like the monster they are. I love the focus on the families which totally breaks your heart.Peters is good, sure. But Nash completely stole the show. The power in her performance outshines Peters in every aspect. This can also be said for main of the secondary characters during the whole series.The way the show progresses and works through the victims is what breaks you down over time. It gives them personality and makes them people, as it should be. Too many true crime shows glorify killers. This show does not do that. This is outstanding TV."},{"id":"rw8615470","title":"A False Shepherd for the Victims","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"This is not the sort of series I generally give a 5. Normally, this would be a 6 or a 7. The cinematography is competent, sometimes good. The production and art design is generally pretty good. The writing is more than adequate, it satisfies and more. The performances are probably the best part, they're actually very compelling; in fact, my curiosity tp see Evan Peters in this role is the only reason I gave Dahmer a shot. But, I digress: shows with above average quality normally get an above average rating from me, except in cases where the show had a damaging effect on the world (for example, the South Park episode that accidentally created gingerism), or which deal with sensitive subject matter insensitively and without a necessary level of tact.Dahmer uses the story of Jeffrey Dahmer for a sensational story with a famous serial killer name brand for extra viewership, but the show never deals with or addresses the effects it might have on the living victims and family of the man himself. I didn't realize this when I started the show, and didn't think too research until halfway through, that Jeffrey Dahmer's parents may still be alive. His father is. I don't know about you, but having seen the series and it's portrayal of Lionel Dahmer, I don't like that one bit. The series never talked to the victims' relatives, either. That's my main issue, but it's a big one. I don't think that you could, in good conscience, make a biopic about a serial killer without talking to the people who live with that trauma every day. It's disrespectful.As well, I think that the changes made to the true story were often morally questionable, such as the depiction of Steven Hicks' murder, which was made significantly less egregious and unjustifiable than the true story. It's not like they made it seem reasonable; but certainly less deranged and much more understandable given the context. I think that the gruesome and horrifying details this show occasionally decides to dance around would make an equally compelling story that the semi truth they choose to tell, and therefore I cannot see any good reason behind it. Even more egregious is the fictional depiction of Jeffrey Dahmer and Tony Hughes as having a reltionship, when in fact Tony was killed just like all the others: the night they met Jeffrey. I found this fabricated friendship between the two to be grossly inappropriate and wholly unnecessary. They could have invented a fake person, instead of distorting the image and life of a real human victim.I have no doubt this story was made with the victims at it's heart, but many questionable choices were made that seem antithetical to that heart. As well, the show was kind of boring toward the end, so yeah. 5/10."},{"id":"rw8615298","title":"An impressive series, chilling and informative.","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"This series looks at the life and crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer, his early years, failed jobs, crimes and victims.I worried early on that it was going to feel long, or stretched out, ten episodes is quite stretch, it wasn't, at no point was this slow or underdeveloped.An incredibly chilling watch, it doesn't hold back, it puts you very close to the action, physically and mentally, you'll be left with strong options of Dahmer, and his hideous crimes.You'll get an idea as to why Dahmer chose the victims that he did, and you'll have an idea as to why he got away with things for so long.It doesn't follow a straight line, it moves backwards and forwards through Dahmer's life as it progresses, but it does make sense, and it really is cohesive.Best episode for me was Tony's story, he was the most developed of the victims, you felt his dreams, ambitions and hopes, only to see them dashed by Dahmer.Great cast, superb acting, it truly is a PowerPoint performance from Evan Peters, he's phenomenal.9/10."},{"id":"rw8615155","title":"A real nightmare!","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"Wow, this series is amazing.

What a woman! It's all just police negligence, no doubt. What are they good for if they don't listen to the alarm signals of the citizens?The only criticism is the slowness that there is in many moments, although it also contributes to increasing the tension!!

There's something dramatic, intense about how that man can transform into his character.The producer (Ryan Murphy) has been working with Evan for more than a decade on American Horror Story so we've seen him in a few different roles and I'm always\nLoving the sometimes \"eerie filming\", there's a sinister vibe in every aspects of the show!"},{"id":"rw8614504","title":"Another gem based on a true story","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"It's a hit. I like crime themes, including murder, and this was pretty damn hilarious. Very interesting. The main draw for me was the fact that it was based on a true story. I enjoyed it. It was interesting to follow the life of Jeffrey Dahmer. The killers are generally interesting and so they are good to work with for the story, which I think worked well here. It went by quickly and I was almost sorry it was over. Not surprising when you can fit the highlights into 10 episodes. I'm just saying that it went by quickly and that I had fun. For me, a great series that I would recommend to crime genre enthusiasts."},{"id":"rw8614341","title":"A brutal truth, a tragedy of a society, which needed to be told....","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"No film or series has ever been able to withdraw as much of a reaction from me as much as this one did whilst watching it. It is intense, gripping, horr-filled, sad, disturbing, and thrilling at times. I would struggle to mention having ever watched a better series than this, truly. It is much more than just being about a serial killer. Nay, it runs much deeper than that. It has so many aspects to it that one would find it hard to capture it in simple writing.Initially, your first impression is that it´s about a serial killer. Then you realise that it´s about a broken family. Then you form the opinion that the blame lies with Jeffrey´s mother, but a while later you discover that his father was an absolute waste of an existence and actually a harmful creature to the society in general and a prime example of what-not-to-be as a father. Then, though, you think that it mildly touches upon the racism prevalent in America, but then you discover towards the end that the whole case is about racism and the preferential treatment of the whites by the authorities over there. You also discover about horrible cases of police negligence. Like, how many of you would believe me if I told you - and the series is based on absolute real events - that the \"white\" American police kept ignoring phone calls from a black woman who kept drawing their attention to the fact that something wrong is happening in Jeff´s apartment all the time throughout the years? How many of you would believe me if I told you that Jeff had \"pieces\" of a dead body in his car and was driving whilst being fully drunk but, him being a white, the poilice let him go with a mild, gracious, warning? Or, or, or - one of the most bizarre things and as one of the greatest examples of negligence - the police returned to this harmless looking white gentleman one of his victims so that he could kill him in peace in his apartment later on? The victim being a 14-year old boy who had managed to run and escape all the way down to the entrance of the building, only to be sent back by two white cops who were just suspended temporarily and returned to work soon. How sick!On the way, you also feel quite clear gracious treatment on the part of a judge of a white guy who was charged for sexually assaulting a minor, and the judge shows very little respect towards the victim or his family. Towards the end you discover that, in America, there´re comic books about such serial killers. Then the final nail in the coffin arrives when, in prison, Jeff receives money and letters of admiration from his fans. All in all, this series holds out a mirror to the great America: its society, its culture, its system, and the way it is run by the authorities. I just cannot praise this Netflix series enough; just can´t. Still, though, here´s a word of respect for Jeff´s paternal grandmother who seemed to be being the only white who was worried about Jeff´s doings and throughout suspected that something was fishy with her grandson.Initially, I had this problem with this series: I questioned the need for making a film or a series on such a creature. My opinion is that such people or their doings should not be made common or be a part of common knowledge or become a topic of discussion in households, and this series does invite that. The thing is that people like Jeff do exist, but only very few of them end up implementing or practising the evil within them and manage to hold their such thoughts to themselves. Such individuals, though, I fear, could be seeing this series as kind of an inspiration or see ideas and suggestions in some of Jeff´s methods as shown in the series. However, given all the factors that I´ve mentioned above, I changed my opinion by the seventh or eighth episode and I, in fact, agree that this was a story, a tragedy of a particular society, which needed to be told. It absolutely had to be told. It was necessary. However, however, I might´ve ideally refrained from making some of Jeff´s acts as graphic and clear. I would´ve rather taken the approach of not showing a lot of the stuff on the screen.Sometimes, a film or a series can be so good that even giving it 10 out of 10 doesn´t suffice, and that´s how I feel here. It deserves way more than just 10 stars. Oh´, and, did I even mention how amazing its fear-inducing background music was? It was terrifying, plain terrifying, folks. Awesome to say the least!"},{"id":"rw8614281","title":"Disturbing","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"Evan Peters is absolutely brilliant in portraying the monster Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered 17 men and often ate their flesh as well. Absolutely sick and disgusting. It also makes me angry how Glenda and the others got ignored by the police. Acting is really top-notch, and I'm also impressed by Richard Jenkins (who played Dahmer's dad), Niecy Nash (who played Glenda) and Rodney Burford (who played Tony Hughes). That Tony episode is so depressing and, in my personal opinion, the best episode of the series.The timeline shifts a lot, so things can be a little bit confusing unless you already know a lot about the Dahmer case, which I don't. The last two episodes are okay. I wish they just skipped the ninth episode, which in my opinion is unnecessary.I recommend this."},{"id":"rw8613652","title":"Fiction show using real names","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"Loved Evans play and other actors....

It made me angry.The serie doesn't give victims any attention, they are use like any characters in any series or movies... I really feel it's a bad use of their names... an offence to their memory and the families.The psychology of the \"Dahmer character\" seems far from reality... I feel like a lot of the script made him sound like someone/something he is not. Lot of what they portrayed as his childhood and all the family stuff along the show is far from reality... Again.SO PLEASE, if you are doing a fiction, don't use the names of people who died under horrible circumstances. Don't use the name of a multitude murderer who've hurt a lot of people and families.Just do a freaking fiction!"},{"id":"rw8613425","title":"Sympathy for the Devil","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"15 October 2022","text":"In parts the story was dramatized, but it was mostly realistic. The acting was uniformly excellent, especially that of Even Peters. It did not go into the full depth of Dahmer's depravity, but it did show the cannibalism. If it had depicted what Dahmer actually did with his victims the show would have been unwatchable. The central theme was is Dahmer insane or evil? It is possible that he was both but the story tried to show sympathy for Dahmer and for his victims. The father, played by Richard Jenkins, was especially well done. The police and the judicial system were treated as either incompetent, racist or homophobic. Dahmer was arrested for an early crime of molestation, but the court did not authorize any kind of psychological help for him. It probably would not have cured him but it was obvious to one psychologist who examined Dahmer that he was a high risk for recidivism.Many criticize this series for not emphasizing the stories of the victims and their families. One episode was almost entirely devoted to one of the victims. Several victims escaped from Dahmer but the police either did not believe them, or the judge did not take Dahmer seriously as a threat to the community. In one scene Dahmer was drunk driving and he had a cut up body in the back seat in plastic bags. He gets pulled over by the police for erratic driving but the police listen to Dahmer's excuses and let him go. Time after time authority figures want to give Dahmer a second chance. There is no police task force to hunt down Dahmer. He is caught almost accidentally. Repeatedly, Dahmers non-white surviving victims or his neighbors are treated with skepticism by the police.Dahmer has amazing skills as a conman. He cons everyone into thinking he is a nice guy, except for one neighbor, Glenda Cleveland, who protests after the police return a 14 year old victim to Dahmer to be murdered. The police never follow up on the boy's condition. When another victim escapes he finally convinces the police to investigate. They find photos that Dahmer took of his victims and that is how he is finally caught. In the trial, his lawyers want to get Dahmer declared to be legally insane, but in doesn't work and he is sentenced to consecutive life sentences. The families impact statements are very powerful emotionally. Dahmer's lawyer wants to keep him isolated in prison to protect him but Dahmer can't stand the loneliness. So he decides to go into the general population. So Dahmers' decision was a kind of self-imposed death penalty. Society gets the revenge it wanted."},{"id":"rw8613403","title":"If you can get through episode 1","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"15 October 2022","text":"I almost gave up on this series because episode 1 was so terrifying.

I wasn't actually going to finish the series until I read reviews that I needed to stick through. And glad that I did because the director in the writer is top notch. I really did know about this story actually I thought I did but after watching all of the episodes all of the biographies didn't even come close. The actors are amazing, the writers amazing, director's amazing, sound amazing, the whole crew is top-notch. I had to stop every episode or two and go back to the real story.

It gave a better understanding, psychologically, of how someone could be so mental.This does contain a lot of violence, all of the reviews based on users votes are correct too.This can be quite emotional if you get quite stressed over these types of films/ series.The main actor, who plays Jeffrey, has performed this role amazing.

I was glued at the screen, probably because the storytelling is so compelling and it leaves you with fear and disgust. Even if Dahmer story is known world wide, this show includes little plot twists that keep you entratained.The acting is also a strong element in this show: the cast was perfect. Other than Evan Peters that was spectacular in such a difficult role, I really liked the character of Glenda. I don't think that Dahmer is the main character of this show, because it seems like many different people around him have a role as big as his.It was a really brilliant show, but I hope that it doesn't bring back the trend of \"loving serial killers\" or imitating them, because there's nothing to romanticise about such disgusting and disturbing acts."},{"id":"rw8613145","title":"I don't usually review...no matter how much I love it.","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"15 October 2022","text":"First off...I'm not a reviewer!

I can't imagine the families of the victims having to relive their nightmare while Netflix and all involved become wealthy and famous.The series did a perfect job at showing us just what kind of monster this man was and insight into his life, but as long as we continue to create and consume this type of content, his victims and their families will continue to be hurt over and over."},{"id":"rw8612759","title":"Disturbing, nerve-racking show with a Powerhouse performance by Peters","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"15 October 2022","text":"This is the show that should be watched by everyone.

And it was boring.Sure, it was well acted and they set it well in that time period, but... No.The time jump all over the place just irritated me. I never like when shows do that. It makes it difficult to keep track of where you're supposed to be.And probably the thing that took me out of it the most, was the families and the neighbours. This just highlighted it was a TV show and not a documentary. When they do a bit of a story showing a victim with the family, they always have the family SUPER nice and supportive of them. Not one of them ever had bad last words to their son/brother. Hardly realistic. Families argue all the time. It happens. Usually doesn't mean anything. But it would have been much more believable if the last words one of the siblings said was \"Remember you owe me $20!\" or \"Don't worry! I'll wash your dinner plates for you, shall I? Lazy!\"\nI know why they did it. It's to show how much they loved them, etc. But it means things have been changed. And now we can't accept anything as true. What else was changed?I dunno.

This is probably by far the most accurate account of events we are ever going to get regarding the life of Jeff Dahmer, The Milwaukee Cannibal. Evan Peters embodied this role in such a unique way, it's not only thrilling but kind of chilling at how well he can truly play a not proven but definitely undeniably, a psycho.

It must be extremely difficult for them to realise that the serial killer is remembered (and often inappropriately revered), when the victims are relegated to a backstory. Unfortunately this seems to have been the norm since the term \"serial killer\" was first coined. When will this change? Who can say?I do think that his victims were portrayed in a very sympathetic way in this series and I really felt for them, especially knowing what their fate was, but I also feel that this production attempts to humanise the monster that Jeffrey Dahmer was and I find that very very hard to stomach."},{"id":"rw8610126","title":"deeply disturbing and shocking, yet captivating","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"14 October 2022","text":"I am a huge fan of serial killer shows and stories, hence saw few adaptations of Dahmer earlier. Hence I knew the story and this series was way beyond my expectations. I recently saw Black bird in Apple (another excellent show) and quite liked, although felt horrific with the lead. I quite liked the idea of bringing it as a series, rather than a movie and liked the subplots involved.It was deeply disturbing from the eerie music to the plot and performances, especially if you watch alone and it may continue to stay with you.Each performance is top notch, especially Evan Peters who performed exactly like Dahmer and was scary throughout. I was quite intrigued throughout but felt very uncomfortable in few scenes.Although you cannot sympathize with the lead due to the crime involved, you still get hooked to the show and would not stop it in between. It was difficult for me to understand that how he got away for so many years which further lead to the brutality involved.I was not sure how fictionalized the series could be, although the story seemed genuine from the journals or news out there.

There's things missed out on though which are maybe too heavy for the series but\nit's already heavy enough so why not if they're in the actual accounts confirmed. Why they made Tony's friend black is pointless as he is an actual bigger part of the story than shown. He was a big suspect in the disappearance of Tony and was realy given a tough time from the police. It also didn't tell the full details of what Dahmer done with his victims after killing them. The clarity of the timeline isn't great either. I have no problem jumping from 1989 to 78 then 91 for instance, but it's only shown what year it's bounced to a few times in this whole series and could be confusing to some.All in all I'd recommend it to friends but anyone who has seen \"Dahmer on Dahmer\" will know more details than given in this 50 hour series."},{"id":"rw8609363","title":"Peters did it extremely well","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"14 October 2022","text":"Why did I give it 10 stars? Because Even Peters played the role of Jeffrey Dahmer damn well. He is exactly the right cast for this character. Peters convinced me from the beginning, the facial expressions, the character, just everything.In itself Dahmer has led a very sad life and also in the documentary it showed me that he did all the terrible things he did because of his sad soul, his fears of loss are shaped by his home, his parents. He had no bond with his mother and his father, with whom he seemed to have a beautiful and loving relationship, was pretty much not there for him at all. In my assumption lies that Dahmer in itself possibly had bizarre character traits, which is not unnatural, because there are many different people, but in his case they were negatively influenced by family circumstances.Ultimately, however, the victims have experienced so much violence and cruelty and it is incomprehensible to normal people how someone can do so much absurd that there is no excuse for all this.

What i found from his scenes & the changes they added was to make people feel empathy for A SERIAL KILLER..\nComments here saying they didn't even take the consent of the victims & their families!! That's why we need to STOP making shows about serial killers and START thinking about the victims."},{"id":"rw8608473","title":"Evan Peters deserves an Oscar for this role","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"14 October 2022","text":"The most intense series I have ever seen. The direction is brilliant and the acting is flawless, specially Evan Peters. He definitely deserves an award for it. They should include this category (OTT) as well.The first 5 episodes almost feel like too much to handle, but you still enjoy every moment of them. The series felt a little dragged out towards the end, but overall it was engaging. Was not a big fan of the timeline shifting back and forth every now and then, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.Thought 'Mindhunter' was the most intense series I watched; until 'Dahmer'.

But that's the only reason to why I give this a 3/10 instead of a 1/10.I've watched lots of true crime, but this series was something else. Netflix has taken a real life event - peoples real trauma (let me remind you that this did not happen thaaat long ago either) - and made it into a tv-show mixed with fictional events. What makes this different from lots of other true crime that I've seen is that they have real actors (who dresses the same as the real victims and of course are named the same thing as them) who they've used to recreate the scenes of the murderers. If you don't find any issues with this ethically yet, please have in mind that lots of the murderers that are shown in this series have made up stuff thrown in to the scenes which never has never happened just to make it more interesting for the viewer. For example the episode that focused on the very sweet deaf guy that unfortunately met paths with Dahmer, that was not at all how his last day looked like. What make this even more ethically wrong, is that Netflix did not even ask or inform the families of the victims first.It's awful how hard Netflix are trying to capitalize on so many completely innocent young mens deaths. This series never should have been made. I feel genuinely sorry for the victims families about having to relive this again, I never would have watched it through if I knew everything I've learned from googling the case now after I've seen it."},{"id":"rw8606837","title":"Is good series","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"13 October 2022","text":"Excellent series that provokes contradictory emotions. We can therefore salute the visual quality, writing and the series seems to reconstruct the Dahmer affair and what happened around it very well. But we are also surprised to feel guilty for appreciating all these qualities knowing that all this really existed. I think that makes this work worse than a horror movie both visually and morally! The series focuses. Making sure that the life of a criminal is told in a real series rather than in a simple documentary really gives a more realistic effect, we feel stronger emotions on the acts that Jeff commits, a bit too long at times, but that contributes to the pervasive tension of the series, to really watch!"},{"id":"rw8606563","title":"Worth all the praise!","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"13 October 2022","text":"Being a teenager from the Netherlands, I had never heard of Jeffrey Dahmer before, but still I decided to take a look. And let me say I was not expecting this...It puts you right into all things disturbing right from the beginning. In my opinion the first episode was already the best one. And from that first episode I already felt like I knew what Jeffrey Dahmer was all about. Evan Peter's portrayal helped alot with that, he was absolutely fantastic in this. The way he looked, the way he talked... everything made him really unsetteling. Also pretty much all the other actors were amazing!The way everything looked it felt like you were always there yourself. And the story was told brilliantly. They worked with a lot of timejumps, which was a really good choice. It was like this: Something happens, then you go back to something in the past until you are back at where you began, which explains so much of the story.I am usually not so much of a guy who watches shows... but this one I watched completely just in a couple of days.8.3/10."},{"id":"rw8606292","title":"every evil story out there","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"13 October 2022","text":"With \"American Horror Story\", Ryan Murphy looked at the human capacity for evil. With \"American Crime Story\", Murphy looked at assorted bad things that have happened in the US in recent decades. His new miniseries \"Dahmer\" could get called a combination of these. The main story is of course about Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) and his hideous deeds. But another facet of the story is how Dahmer's neighbor Glenda Cleveland (Niecy Nash) tried to warn people that something ugly was afoot in his apartment, but her warnings fell on deaf ears. Not to mention that many of the victims were black and gay in an era when AIDS was already ravaging those communities.I understand that the series has drawn accusations of being exploitative, and that some of the victims' family members refuse to watch it. Maybe so, but I found it haunting just to see what Dahmer did. I recommend it if you're willing to see some of these truly grotesque things, and to understand how the authorities refused to acknowledge the warnings.The rest of the cast includes Richard Jenkins (Nate Sr. On \"Six Feet Under\"), Molly Ringwald, Michael Learned and Penelope Ann Miller."},{"id":"rw8606253","title":"Very strong start but too long","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"13 October 2022","text":"The series starts with an amazing 4-5 episodes that have you on the edge of your seat. The acting is superb, the story is captivating and the flow of the series is decent. Unfortunately (as usual) they should have cut the remaining 5 episodes into 3. There is too much focus on activists, racial questions and side characters like Jeff's neighbour Glenda and the Laotian family. But hey, it's Netflix, so what do expect.

Their obsession with the racism card is downright nauseating. It's getting boring now as is this series.I couldn't even get through the whole show as it just got more and more annoying. Really do yourself a favour and give this show a miss. What were the writers thinking when they put this together?"},{"id":"rw8605876","title":"Bone-Cold Disturbing","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"13 October 2022","text":"Absolutely nothing about this mini-series will make you feel good. It was a stark reminder that monsters live among us, and they look like everyday people. Regardless of your sexuality, this twisted series will make you truly ponder the dark side of the human soul.Carl Franklin, Clement Virgo, Jennifer Lynch, Paris Barclay, and Gregg Araki were clearly the best directors for this project. They showed Dahmer for the monster he assuredly was. Writers Ryan Murphy, Ian Brennan, David McMillan, Janet Mock, Reilly Smith, and Todd Kubrak did not play the 'charming killer' card. They portrayed a horrific and twisted person whose story was equally controversial, relevant, and educational.Great musical scoring by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis - minimal yet effective. Jason McCormick and John T. Connor performed amazing cinematography work - that colour palette was especially good. Set decoration, production design and sound effects were outstanding. Hair-makeup and stunts deserve a special shout-out. Rudy Mance's costume design was aces.It couldn't have been easy to play this sick excuse for a person, but Evan Peters deserves a sustained round of applause, and several rounds of other stuff to help him forget about this phase of his career. My spine still tingles as I write about him. By playing Jeffrey Dahmer, Peters has definitively proven that no role is too dark for him. One more favourite actor, check.Richard Jenkins was outstanding as Lionel Dahmer (the father). Shari Dahmer (the second wife), played by Molly Ringwald, was great. Joyce Dahmer (the first wife), played by Penelope Ann Miller, was exceptional. Early-days Lionel Dahmer, played by Josh Braaten, was notable. Early-days Joyce Dahmer, played by Savannah Brown, was superb. The kid version of Jeffrey Dahmer, played by Nick A. Fisher was captivating. Catherine Dahmer (the grandmother), played by Michael Learned, was excellent.Glenda Cleveland (the neighbour), enacted by Niecy Nash, was brilliant. She brought a good deal of humanity to this series, and god knows it needed plenty of that. Tony Hughes, played by Rodney Burford, was memorable. Shirley Hughes, played by Karen Malina White, was amazing. Mayor John Norquist, played by Raphael Sbarge, was good. Reverend Jesse Jackson, played by Nigel Gibbs, was outstanding. Christopher Scarver, played by Furly Mac, was avenging-angel greatness.Detective Murphy, played by Michael Beach, was good. And so was Detective Kennedy, played by Colby French. Tracy Edwards, played by Shaun J. Brown, was noteworthy. Ronald Flowers, played by Dyllon Burnside, was great. Somsack Sinthasomphone, played by Brayden Maniago, was quite good. John Wayne Gacy, played by Dominic Burgess, was a sickening revelation in his own right - a good performance from Burgess.From Dahmer's high school flashbacks, Emma Kennedy as Denise was good. Chazz, played by Colin Ford, had good screen presence. I remember some of Ford's early movies, it was nice to see him on screen again. A rather under-rated performer, if you ask me. Both of them had very little screen time but stood out regardless. Steven (probably Dahmer's first murder victim), played by Cameron Cowperthwaite, was notable.All other cast and crew were mad enough to be part of this production, and did great work. This unnerving mini-series is now streaming on Netflix.Important note: It is only reasonable to avoid assuming the worst about LGBTQ+ people based on what you see in this show. One man's despicable actions should never, in all fairness, be used to judge an entire community.A homosexual splanchnophiliac (one who finds internal organs sexually arousing) sounds like something concocted in a fever dream. However, a slew of news reports, police files, and court evidence have long declared such a monstrous man to be the real deal. Jeffrey Dahmer was a bona fide splanchnophiliac who later took his desire up a few notches and added cannibalism to the list. Regardless of his mental health, Dahmer's actions cannot (in my opinion) be considered human let alone deserving of forgiveness. Some people are just born monsters, I guess.His actions were insufferable and reflected poorly on the LGBTQ+ community who had nothing to do with his way of thinking. Also, I believe a large part of his aptitude was based on upbringing, circumstances, and surroundings. Goes to show how impressionable the human mind can be, and how swiftly it can be consumed by its own dark inclinations.The mini-series also bottled plenty of 90s vibes. Great attention to detail all round. They covered ten or so murders committed by this broken human. I especially liked how they spotlighted the sheer incompetence of Milwaukee's (Wisconsin, USA) then legal system and local police force, both of whom failed time and again to keep this animal behind bars. Not to forget the blind eye his own parents turned to his early 'symptoms' and, dare I say it, silent calls for help. His father later managed to spot the monster within his son, though a tad too late.\"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" has established Ryan Murphy and Evan Peters as a creative duo to reckon with. Their work in this mini-series made me feel sick to my stomach but also impressed at how boldly they managed to capture the wanton cruelty of one man. They way Dahmer disarmed and then took advantage of his victims' helplessness... It was sexual predation, period. His pathological lying only added more fuel to the fire.Get ready to have your heart shattered in episode 6. It was genuinely poignant and surprisingly darker than the other episodes. E07 contained some powerful moments worth appreciating. It balanced out the gruesomeness showcased in the previous episodes. Blame games and accountability also featured strongly in the later epis, and each scene in them was well-crafted.What a show! And to know that every episode was based on a full-fledged real-as-heck human being and his deeply disturbing desires.

When I knew Evan Peters would be cast as Dahmer I was compelled to watch. Though no doubt disturbing, and in many cases I had to look away, I believe this film is of necessity to our society today, and I had no idea that would be the case.In the description for the show it hints to answer the question for why he got away with the continuous murders for 10 years. Throughout the film slowly and then all at once the light is shown on the intense racial injustice, racism in general, and the corruption of the police department. It also touches on just how sick our society can be/oblivious to the reality, (or avoidant of the reality) of what is actually happening.In short, without being phony, overdone, or insensitive to the victims and their families, this mini series really aced an impeccably hard subject to touch on, and more importantly, how to present it.

Every single episode is used to push racism. The character played by Niecy Nash does not live next door. In fact, she lived across the street. There's a scene on a bus that they're showing children throwing things at an African-American child. What did that have to do with the story of an obvious psychopath that turns into a serial killer??? The racist agenda is clearly the number one priority for this series. Even though, Dahmer clearly killed whites and other minorities, they make this series about racism against the African-American community only. Another twisted fact, the deaf victim never had a relationship with Dahmer. He was lured into Dahmer's apartment the same way as many of his other victims, by offering money for taking pictures. This would have been a much better show if they had actually stuck with the facts."},{"id":"rw8605363","title":"Beautiful Art Ruined by Ugly Politics","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"12 October 2022","text":"Great performances all around, especially by the titular character; beautiful cinematography; great scoring, cool soundtrack; virtually ideal source material, since it's based on a true story; all of this adds up to incredibly fertile storytelling ground with nearly unlimited potential.... And what happens? It's all ruined by intentionally divisive politico-ideological messaging. In fact, according to these filmmakers, Dahmer wasn't even the real monster but, rather, just another victim. The real monster, according to them, is Whiteness itself. A system of Whiteness built by and for Whites, knowingly and purposefully exploiting and destroying the Other, Black and Brown people, everyone who isn't part of the Club.

It's a wonderful thing in these sort of series that is often disregarded. However.... MOST OF THIS SERIES IS BS! It is VERY loosely based on facts and so much of what you see is creative writing. Why? Why lie about a serial killer and his victims? Didn't the real Dahmer provide you with enough \"entertainment\"? I can't imagine how disgusted these families are.

In general, ignorance (that of his parents, the police, most neighbors, etc.) is portrayed as the most tragic aspect of whole Dahmer's story and the authors presented it very well in the show.Actors did a solid job as well, especially the main antagonist, the actor who played Lionel Dahmer, and the guy who played the deaf boy."},{"id":"rw8604657","title":"I really wanted to like this but...","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"12 October 2022","text":"First of all, Evan Peters is an amazing actor, and if his character wasn't based on a real person this would have been phenomenal. However, I feel the creators did a great injustice by the way they portrayed Dharmer. It comes off as if he was some insecure, sombre, loner when in reality he was a manipulative, confident and calculating sociopath.It's as if the creators almost want to depict Jeffery Dhamer as being a misunderstood outcast who can't bare to be alone, but the reality was that Dhamer lacked any kind of remorse or empathy for his victims and treated human beings like objects to satisfy his grotesque desires. The real kicker, however, is that the creators didn't even bother to contact a single family member of any victim, re-traumatising them in this process. For a show that claims to 'strive to put the victims' stories and their families' trauma at the heart of the production' they sure have a funny way of showing it. Jeffrey Dhamer is not a brand, he doesn't deserve a narrative.If maybe the creators took inspiration from Dhamer's life instead of trying to retell the story in a way that made Dhamer some kind of victim himself, this would have made for a much better series."},{"id":"rw8604528","title":"Brilliant, uncomfortable, hard to watch... Evan Peters really shines","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"12 October 2022","text":"I'm quite a big fan of crime documentaries and I've watched most of the ones available about the most prolific serial killers of the past. The only one I've never really read or seen much about is Jeffrey Dahmer so I went into this series knowing his name but not really knowing what his crimes were. I took the opportunity to google before watching to familiarise myself with his crimes and what happened to him and I also looked for a quick interview featuring Dahmer himself to see how he was as a person in terms of how we spoke and his mannerisms.I've been a fan of Evan Peters ever since he was in the X-Men films. His transformation through the American Horror Story series was fantastic and he really can turn his hand to any kind of character. He can make you hate him, he can make you feel sorry for him... He really is quite a talent. Now there are obvious similarities between him and Dahmer in terms of looks and this was further Magnified by him having the same hairstyle and colour and the large framed glasses that Dahmer was but it wasn't only a physical aspect. He also has taken a lot of time to evidently study Dahmer and really got into how he carried himself, presented himself, his awkward and seemingly shy demeanour and even how his mouth moved when he spoke. There were times when I was watching this that I completely forgot I was actually watching an actor and it was like I was watching Dahmer himself.By the end of the first episode I was hooked although it surprised me initially that there were 10 episodes because I didn't wanna watch anything that seemed to glorify Dahmer or his crimes. However after finishing the series I see why there were as many episodes is there was and they were actually quite important because they took the time to tell the story from those who were affected by Dahmers crimes instead Pudding focus on him and glorifying him.Probably the most poignant episode for me was the story of Tony Hughes. This followed his diagnosis as deaf shortly after birth due to medication and followed his career dreams and aspirations which made the pain of him being killed all the Morrill. The series also took the time to look at the effect it had on those in the community, how people rallied after he was exposed, the trauma his next door neighbour went through in tirelessly trying to bring him to justice... It really took the time to explore all avenues without really focusing too much on the crimes. Yes they are included and yes they are graphic and horrible but they are important to the series and the storyline.The only episode I struggled with was the last episode when Dahmer has been caught in charge for his crimes and in prison. Whilst initially appearing arrogant, he discovers God and wishes to be baptised. Just as he seems at peace with who he is and seemingly getting his head back on track, he was murdered by a fellow inmate that was disgusted by his actions and felt that he was a vessel for God's well. The problem with the episode was that although it was done really well, it ended up staring at feelings for me where I almost pity Dharma. I don't know whether I pity Danny as a person or whether I pitied Evan Peters version but I felt uncomfortable with the fact that I was feeling pity for such a prolific murderer. It really does make you question.It really does also highlight the horrific racism, segregation and poor efforts of the police and raises serious questions as to why Dahmer was not given support he needed before and why it wasn't picked up. There was a real sense of white privilege afforded to Jeffrey. Whilst I don't think his crimes were particularly racially motivated, there was definite racial profiling on the sides of the police officers dealing with the case.Aside from that it's a really good series. It's hard hitting and even though I'm a lover of guts and gore films, knowing this is based on what really happened and how people really suffered, it can be a bitter pill to swallow. However I think it's done very well without giving any clarification or attention to dharma but instead given the chance for his victims stories to be told and their lives remembered.Evan Peters absolutely shines in this and I can only imagine how hard it was to dive into the psyche of such a troubled serial killer."},{"id":"rw8604503","title":"Slaps Victims Loved Ones in the Face","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"12 October 2022","text":"If this was review was just about the performers, it would get a 10. I watched it because I like true crime. I enjoy seeing how murders are investigated and how murderers are brought to justice. If that had been the focus, I might have rated this more highly. I had heard that the victims' families were upset by this mini-series, and now I know why. It's one thing to make a documentary about a murderer that discusses what happened and how the murderer was caught. It's another thing to re-enact these events in an often disturbing fashion. The question a filmmaker needs to ask him/herself is \"why? Why should I make this film? Will it add anything to our knowledge of this subject and perhaps, in doing so, help us know more about how to prevent such things? I found this film to be gratuitous in its depictions of violence and sex. To make matters worse, the film is misleading in that it depicts events that never happened. Filming a true story often involves making up dialogue that no one can accurately reproduce, but this fictionalizes entire situations, such as making the character of Glenda Cleveland, Dahmer's next door neighbor who keeps complaining about the smell (of dead, dismembered victims) coming from his apartment, as well as sounds of people being hurt or killed. She reportedly placed over 50 calls to the police, most of which went unacknowledged. However, in reality she lived in the apartment building next door, and so could not have done much of what was attributed to her in the film. Quite honestly, this brings into question much of what the movie depicts. The film also depicts much racism and homophobia, particularly within the police department. While that may be accurate, it is difficult to know. Anyway, my three stars for this are for the performances. Otherwise, I think this mini-series is gratuitous in its depiction of sex and violence, and irresponsible in its many falsehoods."},{"id":"rw8603973","title":"A Nightmare Reality, Peters is Brilliant","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"12 October 2022","text":"It has been over 30 years since the Incarceration of The Milwaukee Cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer, The horrific Story of this man's horrific story is brought to Life through the eyes and ears of Emmy Award Winning Director Ryan Murphy, I knew after watching the Trailer, the Gruesome Nightmare Fueled depiction that was about to be released, After watching this gruesome Documentary series, I couldn't help but to question how painful and traumatizing it was for the victims of the families this devil had done to their children, Evans is brilliant, the Attention to detail, remarkable acting, costume designs, location sets, the ability to put his mindset to that of what Dahmers was must have taken a great deal of strong mental capability, The first victim Tracy Edwards was a straight mind blowing horror nightmare experience a creepy setting and a taste of the many grotesque things to come, The inticement and grooming mechanism of a promise of paying him $50 for photographs, leading to his apartment from Hell, this man isn't Freddy nor Jason not even Michael Myers, HE IS REAL!The lack of police help and the dismissal of witness statements was sickening and frustrating in the sense that the injustice of the fellow African-American community allow Dahmer to continue with his heinous crime spree,This documentary was well preserved and kept to an advantage that it does indeed capture the persona and overall living Nightmare of who Jeffrey Dahmer, A messed up and sick minded individual who later suffered the consequences of his dire and disgusting crime spree he swept across the Milwaukee state and destroyed the lives of the victims families, Please take caution whilst watching this Documentary, it is not for everyone to see, It will shock you!"},{"id":"rw8603744","title":"Dahmer is animal and not Saint Dahmer!","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"11 October 2022","text":"I was not going to watch this, because with Netflix nowadays there is a lot of woke garbage that always takes away from the film and this one did have some of the same thing oozing from it! First off, the acting was great... Evan Peters was sensational but it could not save the fact that the writers decided to make Jeffrey Dahmer the victim or as I dubbed him, \"Saint Dahmer.\" That made me sick to my stomach. I continued watching hoping something would change, but with every new show, Dahmer was made to be the victim. I can only imagine what the families felt that lost loved ones to this sick, vile, animal. When the last episode happened, I was thinking okay maybe they'll get the last scene right when Dahmer actually gets killed... but no! Again Saint Dahmer, \"He says something like I'm a born-again Christian and I found God\" or something like this. Even that scene Saint Dahmer. I kick myself for watching this.

All the acting is top-notch and characters are well developed.For the writers, I wonder if they think we are empty vessels, waiting to be filled with hit-over-head Social Justice narratives? The semi-fictional reimagining of the (nevertheless highly commendable) neighbour Glenda Cleveland, who did not live in the same building as Dahmer, is just the beginning. The real adjacent neighbours, the Bass's, are written out as I guess they did not fit the narrative. The two cops who failed to act on Ms Cleveland's phone call, were not given an award.My sense now is that, at least for a generation, all US-produced drama will now be part entertainment and part activist lesson-telling. And therefore, more than ever, viewers will need to see such \"based on true story\" drama as just that - \"based on\" then embellished or fictionalised. Maybe it always was. Just that 20 years ago, the embellishments were for dramatic purposes, and now they are to educate us on Social Justice.So watch the series, then read the fact-check articles and think for yourself. How much was Dahmer \"allowed\" to commit his crime by racists cops? Was his choice of victims racist?

As so often with TV series, it's 90% filler, and the narrative thrust gets lost.This would have worked much better as a movie.Much of the scenes are unnecessary or drawn out in a way that could be shortened otherwise.Sounds of Dahmer doing his horror stuff run over a black screen at one point. This could have been more efficiently handled by doing an L cut and having them run over scenes of seeming normality. Or scenes of his neighbor. There's a story to tell here about police incompetence and Dahmer using his homosexuality as a shield to prevent people from snooping around, or reinforce their stereotype of gay people being weird enough to not investigate the smell and disappearing people. The entire case is a textbook example of police incompetence.The narrative structure is further damaged by the time jumps, which are completely unnecessary in a documentary style series. Tarantino can get away with nonlinear story telling. This material here cannot.Aside from the runtime and narrative focus, the series' biggest detriment is its raison d'etre. Why was this made? Did we really need another series after several movies and series that exploits this tragedy for cheap thrills? Worst of all is the pretense of trying to \"give a face to the victims.\" Yeah right. That's why the series is titled \"Dahmer\". It's exploitation of a tragedy, pure and simple.Now granted, this can still be entertaining or interesting if done right. And a lot of it is interesting. Aside from the curious aspects of the actual case, the acting here is brilliant by everyone involved, especially the lead. He absolutely nails his portrayal of Dahmer with all the small vulnerabilities and the cunning and depravity.If you have nothing better to do and are interested in the case, it's certainly worth watching for the acting alone.If you're looking for horror thrills, you'll be disappointed, since most of the violence isn't shown.If you enjoy faster paced storytelling or expect new information, you will be sorely disappointed. Maybe as with many series there will be a 2 hour fanedit version eventually that can fix the pacing issues. But even so.. you're not missing out on anything of substance by skipping this. It's a big investment of time into watching something that you'll forget about the very next day."},{"id":"rw8601681","title":"Not okay","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"10 October 2022","text":"As someone who partakes in viewing true crime content, this is very disrespectful.

He'd been operating for years, luring primarily young, gay black men back to his home, before drugging them, sexually abusing them and murdering them, and in some cases even consuming their body parts. The apathy and incompetence of the police aided greatly in his ability to evade detection for so long, targeting young, marginalised men who were disregarded by the police and society in general, casting a wider eye over the culture of the time in general.Netflix seems to churn out a 'true life crime' series on a whim every few months, focusing on real life interviews with some of the most sinister and calculating killers ever to have walked the earth, aiming to delve into their psyches and make sense of their minds. And so we have this well received ten part production, charting the life and crimes of Jeffrey Dhamer, truly a worthy contender in the 'most evil killer ever' stakes. Told in reverse from the moment of his capture and arrest, it depicts his childhood, as a quiet but withdrawn child living with his doting but quarrelling parents, being walked over at school, before an unstable and fractured early adult life, unable to commit to anything or stick at a job, before having to go back and live with his dad, stepmom and temperamental grandmother.In the lead role, Peters is undeniably effective, portraying Dahmer with a cool, calm detachment and iciness that seems to be pretty much a mirror image of the real life monster. But, with that said, somehow it's Richard Jenkins's supporting role as his father that leaves the most searing impression, projecting an unnerving ordinariness as the dad forced to come to terms with the shattering truth about his son. While undoubtedly a man with flaws and his own personal problems, he's still fundamentally a typical, all American dad, driven to doubt his own sanity, going through the motions as events unfold. It's common to imagine monstrous serial killers being abused, neglected and all the usual stereotypes of their parents that have been fixed in our brain, but Jenkins impresses what is probably the reality very effectively.On a wider scale, as if the crimes of Dahmer weren't horrific enough, the case exposed the wider attitude of the police and society in general towards black communities and homosexuals, paving the way for lessons to be learned and wider societal change. Overall, a well managed, eerie and uncomfortable piece, that never veers over the edge and glamorises the crimes of its subject in any way. ****"},{"id":"rw8601222","title":"So boring!","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"10 October 2022","text":"I have tried to watch but OMG this story moves at a snail's pace.

Good grief. It really takes forever and a day to explain the most minute detail. The entire movie is supposed to be from the outside looking in. I get that! I appreciate that! Maybe an art style movie wasn't the right choice. The average, non serial killer human being doesn't see serial killer and cannibalism as art.

To portray a character means literally bend your mind and mood towards the whims of that character. To top it off he portrayed a serial killer with intricate details in the fashion in which the real Dahmer made the kills! To an extent this show captured the emotional trauma so brilliantly that sometimes you yourself will get traumatized of the world around you. Last but not the least, the research work that went into this is absolutely remarkable. The show is slow but the built up of the climax to every kill is so much worth the effort and the wait.

It has brilliant actors, phenomenal arts staff, decent soundtrack, great editing and a decent script. I enjoyed watching this series very much, but I do have a few criticisms I'd like to share: the depiction isn't entirely accurate. I encourage the viewers of the show to engage with the real life material regarding JD and his victims. Many parts were either left out, changed or dramatized to the point of discomfort (policemen getting an award after being reinstated, Glenda Cleveland becoming a next door neighbor, Tracy being gay and that's just of the top of my head). In addition, it doesn't sit right with me that the families of the victims were not contacted or paid by Netflix. Legally speaking, they didn't have to, but it doesn't make it morally just. In addition, the race aspect of the case had been dialed way up, and it was clear there was a cynical use of the story to promote current race tension similarly done in \"when they see us\" or \"Karen\", but in this case it is all the more reprehensible since JD was a real person, and more importantly- so we're his victims.To conclude, I do recommend the series, but watch it with a critical eye.

I watched this series and ended up feeling sorry for Dahmer. The word \"empathy\" fits here. Dahmer like all of us was born innocent. An innocent young boy who witnessed domestic abuse and the abhorrent abandonment by his mother (thus leaving the home available for his first kill). Before he killed and abused people, Dahmer, like us all, deserved love, warmth, kindness and understanding. His basic needs should have been met. He should have been encouraged. He needed friends, companionship and stability. He seemingly never had much of any of these. Even the people in his life whom were good to him (his father and grandmother) didn't understand him. This was a lonely, mentally unwell, empty and sad young man who couldn't relate to others. He was so terrified of people leaving him; he killed them. A happy and content person doesn't do this, do they?How and why do I feel sad for Dahmer after watching this show? Perhaps because I can empathise deeply with a person's situation. I know he was once a little boy. His life could have been so different. What on earth went so horribly wrong?Or did Ryan Murphy do this me? What was his motive? What did he want us to feel? Did he intend to make us feel bad for Jeff? If so, why?I was also an Evan Peters fan before watching this so perhaps I can't separate him from Dahmer.Regardless, just be careful watching this. I couldn't stop thinking about Dahmer afterwards. Searching, reading, non-stop interview watching.

Whether it's giving this dude more attention or not contacting the real-life victims or whatever else is being said.Personally, I'm not interested in these debates. The morality of cinema has always been a topic I've intentionally steered away from, because who am I to say what is and isn't \"right\".My top priority is always story. And as far as this one goes, I was far more impressed than I thought I would be. However, I do think it starts to lose itself a bit once the focus moves away from Jeffrey/his father and emphasizes too much on the impact of the victims. I imagine this was intended to pay tribute to the real-life people, but nonetheless it resulted in a serious drag in the overall narrative.In my opinion, the show hits the hardest when it remains fixated on Jeffrey's spiral into madness and the ever-increasing evolution of his relationship with his father. Once that moves from the spotlight, it becomes a bit monotonous.But overall, this was an extraordinarily fascinating show."},{"id":"rw8600413","title":"Brilliant if at times Unfocused","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"10 October 2022","text":"A sick and evil serial killer who done unspeakable things to his victims is shown on full display, sometimes sadistic, sometimes playing the victim, Jeffrey was if nothing else a highly captivating person in Dahmer. From the outset the first episode really draws you in to what Jeff's MO was. Meaning what his tactic was for capturing and killing his victims. They lay out the first episode very well and have most of the story on display setting a general timeline for what has happened over the years. The next few episodes are a bit more average, consisting of flashbacks to Jeff as kid growing up and how he worked his way to killing, it's told well and acted even better so it's more than enough to keep you watching closely. Towards the final few episodes I felt like I had already seen everything to piece together exactly what the outcome was so it seemed to drag slightly at the tail end. One downside is the story itself should clearly be centred around the serial killer and what he done to his victims, who were from a vast array of races and creeds but instead certain episodes take time to push certain stereotypes and agendas onto us. The police are always the bad guys, they always messed up. People of certain races are always innocent etc. This is especially prevalent in the Casandra episode where it spends more time focused on racial matters than actually getting on track with what the show is about. This leads to a misguided nature at points and sadly nowadays this underlying message inserted into writing has become common place in most forms of media. Overall the show has a decent enough storyline and is structured well to what happened that it remains a really good captivating watch."},{"id":"rw8600028","title":"Give Evan Peters his award, already!","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"10 October 2022","text":"This show is somehow intense, bingeworthy, and a beautiful artistic show at the same time.

I feel like the writers did a wonderful job of showing us Dahmer's perspective, and what made him the killer we know him to be. It was hard for me to watch at times.I can't say enough about Evan Peters. He's an underrated, phenomenal actor. He becomes his character. At times, I forgot that this is an actor, not Dahmer. I don't get creeped out easily, but he definitely gave me the creeps. He's truly brilliant!I've had issues with other documentaries or true crime dramas because they tend to glorify the killer. Not this one! There are times when I might have empathized with him (when he was younger), but he is certainly not glorified. We see a lot more about the victims. I especially loved watching the episode about Tony. The fact that we see the victim's perspective, even in the cinematography and audio, is amazing.I understand some people have issues with certain liberties that the creators have taken, but I don't think they deviate from the main tragedy or events. I knew going in that Glenda wasn't the next door neighbor, but it didn't bother me.Some people also have an issue with the show trying to be \"woke.\" It's really not. While I can't attest to the prank calls and few other details, much of the frustration we feel with the investigation (or lack thereof) is true. Dahmer was operating during a time when racism, homophobia, and misconceptions around HIV were rampant. Not that these issues have ended, but it was much worse then. We can't deny that.I think the show is beautifully done, and the actors have done a phenomenal job. It's not a gorefest, but it's disturbing.

The fact that nearly all the victims were black homosexuals, just spent they were easy pray for this serial killer.The series takes a lot of effort to show through various stages of his life to see how he ended up being a mass murderer.

I normally wouldn't watch such a gruesome movie if the production was mediocre. But this series is outstanding, The writing is perfect. The acting, editing, directing, casting-all of it gels perfectly together. I got deep into it within 2 minutes.Evan Peters gave an incredibly inspired performance. You just never knew that underneath that calm, good looking face was an astonishingly sick monster. But you knew he was sick. He was the perfect actor to cast in this role. He didn't have to act like he was sick. It was so natural to him. It was as if he was Jeffrey Dahmer. I remember reading about him in the 90s when the story broke. I couldn't read the whole article, it was so disturbing.Yes, the creators and writers, Ryan Murphy and Ian Brenner, plus a few other writers, even were able to show a sympathetic side to this killer. Don't know if this is part of the real Jeffrey Dahmer story or a figment of the writers' imagination. You can even understand why he did the things he did.When I saw Richard Jenkins was in this movie, I knew it would be a good one. He knows how to pick good movies. He was great in his role as Jeffrey's father. So perfect as the hot and cold father.You may think, as I did, that this movie is a single-minded sensational story about a serial killer. You certainly get that impression in the first few episodes. But it turned out to be not a simple story.Monster lays out a much deeper, more complicated and wider landscape. The writers accomplished the Herculean task of artfully fleshing out a few of the victims' lives with their families. At first, I didn't know where the writers were going with these subplots. But then I realized the writers were showing that these victims were normal, nice people. They were loving sons and brothers, they had jobs, they were gay, they weren't criminals and they weren't drug addicts.They were beguiled by Dahmer's sweet sexy face and demeanor. He sweetly and politely lured them into his apartment, gave them coffee or soda or beer and put inside a drug that rendered the man helpless. Why he drugged them comes out in a later episode. There's more to it than your first impression.There are 2 elephants in the room in this series: racism and testosterone. The writers don't really play up these words but their behavior is clearly present. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin police department was not incompetent, as some reviews and people say. They were racist. Dahmer was a normal-looking white man and almost all his victims were black, brown or Asian. Plus they were all gay, which was taboo and untouchable in the 70s and 80s. If Dahmer were a black man and all his victims were white, you can be sure he would've been arrested far sooner. The Milwaukee police ignored, avoided and neglected any complaints that had to do with Dahmer.All throughout this series, the writers explore the one question that is on everyone's mind, especially his father's. Why? Why did Dahmer capture, imprison, torture, kill and eat 17 human lives? What drove him to do this? The father wonders if he passed his DNA on to his son. He wonders if his son was affected by them dissecting roadkill together in their garage. The father wonders if the mother's neglect turned him into such a cruel person. They did not, however, explore the practical and scientific aspect. Testosterone is the male hormone that causes violence, aggression and domination. Dahmer was extremely violent, aggressive and had a driving need to dominate, which is why he drugged all his victims. His psychiatrist did not check his testosterone level to see if it was dangerously high. No one made the connection between Dahmer's behavior and his hormone levels.Evan Peters Is up for a 2023 SAG award for his role. Richard Jenkins should be recognized for his excellent supporting role as the father, which only got better and richer as the series went on.

The first episode sets the tone perfectly by luring the viewer into the mind of Dahmer through the experience of a victim. Evan Peters does an incredible job at portraying Dahmer, everything down to voice and mannerism is so well-acted it's borderline creepy.The show manages to portray the gruesome murders without being overly explicit about it, which in a way only adds to the physical discomfort you get from watching it. Instead of seeing blood you instead get to imagine it, which is way more scary. Combined with being beautifully shot and acted, you feel as if you're almost there seeing the real Dahmer himself hunt down and kill his victims.Unfortunately the show reaches some sort of blind alley from Episode 7 and forth, when the writers start to take too many liberties with the script. Up until that point the show felt very focused, grounded and straight to the point, but then all of a sudden it becomes a political story about discrimination, police incompetence and racial injustice where the writers hijack the story in order to send a message rooted in today's racial climate as of 2022. I mean, I wouldn't mind watching another show about those things but it felt incredibly forced, especially since Dahmer did not discriminate when it came to the color of his victim's skin - he didn't target black people or minorities, but the last four episodes is all about that which kind of ruins everything that came before. And I hate to break it but it's not just that interesting to watch through 1 hour of the victim's families sitting down talking about how miserable they feel. Most people watch these type of shows because they want to see inside the mind of the serial killer himself.It also doesn't help that a lot of the stuff in the last four episodes is made up, skewed or deliberately pushed aside in order to fit the \"message\" that the writers wanted to shove down our throats. What a shame. This could've easily been a 10/10 show if it wasn't for the fact that Netflix, just like Dahmer himself, just can't help themselves."},{"id":"rw8598217","title":"Very good strory telling","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"9 October 2022","text":"The movie tells the sorty in a ellegant and correct way.

The actor who plays Dahmer capture's the character's sense of humiliation and dominance in his quiet, heavy breathing and dead eye stares.I quite liked the relationship portrayed between Dahmer and his father, which is troubled and sincere, depicting a father who did his best but also may have damaged his son, though unintentionally and without malice.When the focus shifted off Dahmer and his immediate family, I believe the show began to unravel as the other characters just do not come across as nuanced or as strong. Respect to the victim's families, but I believe there should instead be a different show that can make a fuller effort at getting to know who was impacted.I did decide to skip through most of the series. I do think \"Dahmer\" is two kinds of tv shows in one, which did not quite work for me, and made the series seem overlong.I do take issue with the 'vengeful god' death at the end. When you do a series about a serial killer, you kind of have to put aside trying to force a moral perspective. And it felt like the end tried to force that moral lens. So as a viewer to me that felt like an imposition, and like signposting.Anyway the parts that is a psychological study, I appreciate. The parts that are signposting, I tuned out. That's probably unfortunate as there is legitimate issues brought to light. However, repeating a message in the same way tends to do that.

They could have written the character to be the real person who loved next door to Damher, Pamela Bass.Likewise, the Sinthasomphone family wasn't even at Dahmer's sentencing for molesting their son/brother, so the fact that the scene was depicted the way it was is entirely inaccurate.Lastly, although the officers in reality did not handle anything with this case well, the two officers were not named as \"officer of the year\". Also interesting that fake information like that would be added in."},{"id":"rw8598040","title":"Not Accurate!","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"9 October 2022","text":"Was really enjoying this until I found out that Glenda cleavland actually lived in an entirely different building than Jeffrey dahmer did. This is just another example of wokeness. I don't understand why Netflix and other Hollywood productions have to push there narrative in our faces with everything they make. It's getting to be ridiculous with all the In accuracies in all of there productions. Also the police officer scene where they received officer awards of the year was false aswell. Anyway that's just my take on this I didn't enjoy it at all and if your looking for some false narrative to push there agenda then this Is for you."},{"id":"rw8598025","title":"Serial killer has left the building.","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"9 October 2022","text":"This is not a thriller series but more like a documentary drama. The attempt of presenting this disturbing story is such lame, almost comedy oriented way is very disappointing to watch. The unsuitable dramatization, luck of thrill and bad acting from boring Evan Peters all over the episodes make it unpleasant.The story loses it's severity with the unnecessary gay explicit content, thanks to the writers's fantasies, has the Ryan Murphy stamp. Glenda Cleveland's story is explained way too much. Best acting comes unexpected from Richard Jenkins and Rodney Burford.Overall it's not what the real fans of ID or Crime Investigation would like to watch but its more for the netflix public viewers."},{"id":"rw8597705","title":"extremely disturbing","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"9 October 2022","text":"This was extremely extremely difficult to watch. I kept pausing every two seconds 'cause it was getting hard to breathe watching this. My stomach hurt so much throughout the entire show.Before I started watching, my roommate told me a little about him & I made a joke saying, oh we're so alike, we both love the person for what's inside them. Well, I regretted ever even thinking that when I was watching the second episode.Throughout the show, the thing I felt towards Dahmer wasn't hate, or anger, or love. It was partially disgust, partially pity, partially confusion, partially sadness and whole lot of being disturbed. Pity, because, his childhood seemed so familiar. Although, I would still say it was much much much much better than mine. Watching this series made me scared I'd end up like him. Hopefully not, I have more than enough friends thank god. Loneliness does make you extremely weird to the world tho, who else would know better than me.I loved that this series showed all the sides, everyone's perspective. My heart hurt so much for Tony. He deserved better, that was so confusing for me."},{"id":"rw8597319","title":"Excellent show","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"8 October 2022","text":"Evan Peters is excellent in the lead role and really captures Dahmer. Overall, the show is excellent. They do a good job of really allowing focus on the victims while telling the story. Really difficult subject matter to get right and they did a good job.There are a couple of episodes that are unnecessary, creating a composite character to tell a story that really isn't needed but seems a prerequisite for all movies and tv shows these days.In my opinion, episode 7 is totally unnecessary, it would have made more sense to just tell the story of the real people rather than merge them, other than that the show is 10/10."}]
