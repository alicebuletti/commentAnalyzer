Having been a young adult when all this happened, it....what do the kids say?...it hits different.Well, it's the Dahmer story. So by default, it's hard and gross and scary.The acting is top notch. Every performance...it's like you're right there in the room watching this God awful series of events unfold in real time. How the actors got through this is beyond me.The timeline shifts can be a bit hard to follow. It's not the kind of thing you can just pause and come back to. You have to rewind or start the episode over.Overall, arguably...this is the best Dahmer depiction. I would recommend watching \"My Best Friend Dahmer\" prior to watching this, as it accidentally and appropriately serves as a prequel.Recommend for cast iron stomachs. Don't watch this if you're prone to puking."},{"id":"rw8559090","title":"It is like Mindhunter - you will learn how someone became a serial killer","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"21 September 2022","text":"When I clicked to watch the \"Dahmer\"-release on Netflix, I thought it would be the so-many'th documentary on him. But what a surprise it was to see that it is actually a mini-series of the crimes that Dahmer committed. And what a mini-series it is!The acting is superb. The script is top-notch! The cinematography one of the best that I have seen in a true crime series of a serial killer!I am a big fan of Mindhunter, the show about the origins of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. And I must admit that Dahmer fits right into this type of shows! The show captured me from the first episode and it was a single binge from then on.I know that there are many other movies from for instance \"People's Magazine\" that portray the crimes commited by notorious killers. But what Netflix has shown with Dahmer, is a complete new level of enactment! The movies from People's Magazine are just amateur hour compared to the Dahmer-series.Netflix really surprised me big time with this great show! It deserves a solid 9 stars! And I don't easily give away a 9 star rating!"},{"id":"rw8558692","title":"Evan Peters is brilliant!","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"21 September 2022","text":"I had high expectations of this. After seeing Evan Peters in AHS, I just knew he would be great in this role. He did not disappoint.I haven't seen many docos on Dahmer so don't really know that much about his personality or demeanor, but the character that Peters portrays is complex, creepy, and just plain twisted and evil.One of the most disturbing details of Dahmer's crimes that this series highlights is how the police ignored and dismissed witness reports, and their lack of action allowed Dahmer to stay free and kill more men.This series is excellent. I suggest you start watching it early in the afternoon as you will want to binge watch the whole series."},{"id":"rw8769205","title":"Tough to watch","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"31 December 2022","text":"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is a series created by Ryan Murphy (American Crime Story, American Horror Story, 9-1-1, Hollywood, Pose, Feud, etc.). Everything Murphy touches is pretty much successful and this is no different. Everyone knows this story by now...he's one of the most notorious serial killers in the history of the United States. He would lure young men to his apartment and not only kill them but eat them. This is a story that's been told many times but this show takes the unique perspective of largely telling the story from the victims point of view. Evan Peters is absolutely brilliant as Jeffrey Dahmer. He's so good that he should be talked about for an Emmy nomination next year. This series is worth watching for Peters performance alone. This is very dark, disturbing story and Ryan Murphy does a great job telling it."},{"id":"rw8560345","title":"Where's Evan's Award for Best Performance of the Year?","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"22 September 2022","text":"There are no doubts that Evan Peters has killed this role by delivering one of the most engrossing performances of his career, and that's saying something considering the aptitude of his many esteemed performances to date. Dahmer's entire childhood outfitted for audiences to get a further in depth understanding of his delving into degeneracy and the reasons behind his atrocious actions. The fault of a system that didn't care about helping those who showed signs of psychosis and allowed a young man to fall through the cracks along with a corrupt and negligent police department that chose to turn blind eyes and deaf ears due to the nature of homosexuality and people of color being Dahmer's main victims because of obvious systemic racism...all of it set to Evan's performance was outstanding. I can only hope people learn from the many lessons this horrible tragedy, but the engrossing way that Mr. Peter's acted in this very challenging role is an absolute stunner."},{"id":"rw8560210","title":"Compelling and repellant in equal measure, Dahmer is the most definitive look at not just the titular killer, but the origins and fallout of his heinous actions.","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"22 September 2022","text":"Starting in July 25, 1991, notorious serial murderer Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) is arrested when Dahmer's potential victim Tracy Edwards (Shaun J. Brown) miraculously escapes and brings the police back to his apartment. Dahmer is arrested after uncovering the various horrors and mementos from Dahmer's murders, we soon go back through Dahmer's past to see what lead him to this point before eventually shifting focus to the stories of the victims, the fallout felt by the community and victims' families, as well as the bureaucratic and law enforcement failures that allowed Dahmer to continue indulging his twisted appetites.Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is the latest project from noted producer Ryan Murphy whose prolific work on the likes of American Horror and Crime Story lead to him getting an overall deal with streamer Netflix. Beginning development in 2020, the miniseries is the fourth dramatic take on the infamous serial killer following three independent productions, 1992's The Secret Life, 2002's Dahmer, and 2017's My Friend Dahmer receiving very degrees of responses with My Friend Dahmer arguably the best of the three. When the miniseries was first announced I was skeptical because I didn't think there was any more to be told about Dahmer than we'd already learned from years of rubbernecking let alone three film attempts, but much to my surprise I found this miniseries to not only exceed my expectations, but shattered them as Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the year's best TV shows and if you end up seeing only one Dahmer related piece of media in your life, make it this one.While the show may be titled after serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, he's only half of what this movie is about. While the first 3 or four episodes dive extensively into Dahmer's childhood from age six where he first began to manifest his macabre interest in dead animals and dissecting them through his teens and 20s where we see the effects of Dahmer's unstable homelife, repressed homosexuality, and darkening appetites, the movie places more focus on the lead-up to Dahmer's actions as well as the fallout that came after the horrifying revelations came to light (and not just with Dahmer himself). Intermixed with the scenes of Dahmer socially engineering his victims, struggling with keeping his compulsions in check, or failure to maintain professional and personal relationships, we're shown a series of failures either through incompetence, apathy, distraction or neglect that disregard the obvious warning signs surrounding Dahmer as he deals with barely concealed issues that are missed by parents, educators, law enforcement, or administrative officials with those who actually try to shine a light on Dahmer's actions ignored at best or punished or threatened with punishment at worst. This is a show that despite being set in the early 90s is no less prescient today with issues such as systemic racism and homophobia still very much allowing inaction or harm to victims, and an award ceremony scene where two police officers are rewarded for simply avoiding responsibility for handing a child over to Dahmer will make your blood boil with how little has changed in regards to the \"blue wall of silence\" and the corruption of police unions in keeping unfit officers out of the profession.The acting is solid across the board. Evan Peters is really good is the titular Dahmer as he captures the tragedy of his situation in the early years, but Peters and the creative team don't try to use this as an excuse or easy answer (an epilogue says as much there's no simple answer) and Dahmer's metamorphosis from struggling confused adolescent to cold calculating opportunistic predator who justifies his actions with a false victimhood complex makes it clear that Dahmer's actions have no \"out\" from his responsibility for them. The movie is an ensemble and features a number of characters either recurring or one off who are integral to the plot. Easily my favorite comes in the form of deaf actor Rodney Burford who plays Dahmer's victim Tony Hughes and the entire episode is anchored to the POV of this character with characters using ASL to communicate, muffling the audio to create verisimilitude, and you feel like you get to know Hughes in a way we've never been allowed to see before. Make no mistake, this is a starmaking performance from Burford so expect to see much more of him in the future, I guarantee it. The show also features terrific performances from arguably the two \"cores\" of this movie, Niecy Nash as Dahmer's neighbor and until now unsung hero of this story Glenda Cleveland, and veteran character actor Richard Jenkins as Dahmer's torn and conflicted father Lionel.With Nash's Glenda, we get the feeling of powerlessness and helplessness from the people on the ground affected by Dahmer's actions as noted in the movie that Dahmer lived in a cheap rundown part of Milwaukee and targeted mostly people of color as his victims. While Glenda reports the awful smells coming from Dahmer's apartment to the landlord as well as sounds of screening of fighting to the police, not only is she often ignored, but is shouted down by the police such as the infamous incident wherein officers John balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish took Dahmer's word that 14 year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone was actually his drunk 19 year old boyfriend instead of his victim who'd been given an amateur lobotomy by Dahmer instead of an escaped victim despite Glenda's pleas. The movie isn't excessively gory as the gore is limited to only plot important scenes, but just because it's not as bloody as Saw or Hostel doesn't make it easier to watch and in some cases it's actually harder. Richard Jenkins is really strong as Dahmer's father Lionel and the different points of the story that portray him as wanting to help his son but not knowing how are heartbreaking because you see in Lionel the confusion and discomfort that make him unable to give Dahmer the help he needs because he very much denies there even is a problem and tries to write it off as something that can be cured with tough love or firm guidance. There isn't any singular point of blame you can link to Dahmer (as the show isn't about \"understanding Dahmer\"), but the show does give us some potential issues such as a mentally unstable mother, a distant father, and internalized feelings of abandonment, but even then these aren't frame as excuses. The show stays good even after the actual crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer are over and done with by the halfway point, as the show shifts focus away from Dahmer and looks at the media fallout, the insane fandom surrounding Dahmer, the exploitation of tabloids and indie comics that trivialize Dahmer and his victims, and to watch these victims and their families be at the mercy of harassing phone calls and invasive pictures by rubbernecking tourists is painful to watch.If I haven't made it clear, Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the best TV projects I've seen this year and I can't recommend it enough. My one point of criticism is I felt certain tangents related to Ed Gein and John Wayne Gacy seemed a little out of place and I wasn't sure why they were presented the way they were with such polished detailed flashbacks, but other than that one misstep I really think everyone should see this show."},{"id":"rw8570779","title":"Evan Peters is terrific here!","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"27 September 2022","text":"I want to star off by saying Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer story (what a ridiculous title) is a very tough watch. I grew up about 30min from Milwaukee and even though I was a little kid when he was arrested I still remember this story being a huge, especially around here. How he was able to get away with what he did for as long as he did is very troubling. The police dropped the ball time and time again and lots of innocent lives were lost because of it. Evan Peters deserves every bit of recognition he's getting from this series, he was brilliant. The rest of the cast is good too but it's Peters who makes this show what it is."},{"id":"rw8689538","title":"Probably the most realistic portrayal of a serial killer i've ever seen","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"22 November 2022","text":"Evan Peters has seriously outdone his job here. His acting was top notch and his portrayal of dahmer, from his clothing to expressions, everything was perfect, perfect everything, down to the last minute details. And apart from him, the performances of the other cast members (His father, his mother, grandma, Glenda cleveland and the victims) were excellent too.Also, the cinematography and music was impressive. The writing and screenplay was decent too, especially the fact that they didn't did much creative liberties, and hence as a result, the story turned out to be close to the actual events. The only thing i found slightly disappointing was the length. The pace was a bit slow, especially in the last few episodes, and i feel the series could've been easily wrapped up in 8 episodes, instead of 10.But overall, it's a must watch. Especially for the ones who are interested in the crime thriller genre. It's a realistic take on one of the most notorious series killers in our history, where they haven't romanticized him and in fact, called out the ones who tend to do so. And that's the thing which makes it a bit unique and interesting to watch."},{"id":"rw8561605","title":"A dark, taut and compelling docudrama.","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"22 September 2022","text":"For those interested in the psychology of a serial killer, there is no more fascinating character study than Jeffrey Dahmer. He was a psychiatric enigma and a profoundly sick individual. A chronic alcoholic from a very young age. A sexual deviant with all manner of unusual fetishes. A necrophiliac. A cannibal.A pure psychopath and the product of a perfect storm of schizotypal/borderline personality disorder, developmental toxicity (exposure to psychoactive drugs in utero), negative parental influence, neglect and childhood trauma, a morbid curiosity with the macabre, social exclusion at school and deep feelings of loneliness, sexual confusion and insecurity.He longed to be cared about and loved by his family. He longed to be accepted by his peers. But, at the same time, knew deep down that he would inevitably disappoint his parents because of his inability to live a normal life and that he wouldn't be accepted by friends due to his odd personality.We all tend to seek out like-minded people and make connections with those we have something in common with. The problem was that Jeffrey knew there wasn't anybody out there with the same interests or outlook as him. Left to his own devices by absent parents and socially isolated, he became increasingly withdrawn and followed a path of introversion and solitude.He must have felt like he didn't belong in this world, and that there wasn't a place for him within society, so he abandoned all attempts to participate and pursued a voyeuristic way of life. He lacked a clear or positive self-image, meaning his perspective of other people was skewed, which resulted in him fully embracing his warped perception of pleasure and satisfaction. The men he felt attracted to were purely sex objects to him; walking, talking sex dolls. His interest was solely in their aesthetic, or physical appearance.He appeared to have been a deeply troubled soul from the outset and his behaviours were predominantly a consequence of his genetic constitution, exacerbated by negative life experiences. If his childhood had been a more positive one then he may have been able to adapt better to his personal limitations and dysfunctions, but there is no way of knowing the extent of the damage his upbringing had on him.It was evident from his own admissions that he felt predestined to live a peculiar and unorthodox lifestyle due to his innately bizarre persona. The conventional joys of life simply didn't float Jeffrey's boat.I rarely, if ever, feel sorry for multiple murderers, especially ones who commit such heinous and sickening crimes as Dahmer. But I have to admit that I found his story to be tragically sad.My usual take away from accounts of serial killers is wondering how and why someone could do that to another human being over and over again!? In Dahmer's case, I am left feeling conflicted with a strange understanding of, and empathy for, his actions. Of course I'm not condoning what he did, but I can see how and why the sequence of events transpired.In his televised interviews he was so open, frank and forthcoming which is exceptionally rare for someone in his situation. He came across as a gentle, thoughtful and articulate person who was genuinely tormented by his inner demons throughout his life. He freely admitted to his crimes in detail, demonstrated that he knew what he had done was evil and offered honest explanations for his actions. He wanted to pay the ultimate price for his sins, resisting advice to make a plea of insanity, and took personal responsibility for the choices he made.The good part of him wanted to change and stop what the bad part had started, but he required external intervention to do so. The urges and compulsions that controlled him became an obsession and his psychosis led him down a progressively irreversible path that was impossible to resist. The dark side had an unrelenting grip on him.My personal opinion is that he was clinically insane, due to a combination of psychiatric disorders, but at the same time I feel a legal judgement of insanity would have been an insult to the families of Dahmer's victims and an inadequate penalty for such a fiendish series of killings.If you listen to him describe how he felt during his childhood and adolescence, it's clear that he should have been under the watchful eye of mental health professionals from an early age. His mother was so wrapped up in her own mental illness and his father preoccupied by work that he didn't receive the emotional support, medication and therapy he desperately needed. This was inexcusable given that both parents were acutely aware of their own emotional problems and the likelihood that these had been passed onto their son.I can't help but feel pity for Dahmer, and also that the casualties of his maniacal way of life were preventable.Between his mid-teens and early twenties he was basically a \"walking cry for help\" but nobody seemed to pay attention, try to understand him or find out what was wrong. In any case, because of the appalling and unspeakable nature of Dahmer's fantasies, it's unlikely that he would have felt able to share them with anyone, even those in a medical capacity. This would've made him feel trapped and that he might as well turn his fantasies into a reality because there was nobody to confide in and no way out of his spiralling mental condition. Like a lost cause.I mean here was a guy who felt completely alone in the world. A total and utter misfit. So reckless and uncaring about what other people thought of him, making absolutely no attempts whatsoever to conform to social norms. A loner without even a rudimentary inclination or understanding of how to make friends, relate to others or find a romantic partner. He didn't seem to know what to look for or what he wanted in a partner. His perverted version of attachment and sexual arousal didn't allow him to.I suppose all he had experienced was watching his parents at constant loggerheads and in a loveless marriage. This would have left him detached, emotionally stunted and unaware of how to express love and affection. I suspect realising that you're homosexual is a troubling and confusing time for anyone. But for someone like Dahmer, who was mentally unhinged and devoid of emotional support, it was a major dilemma and yet another psychological obstacle to contend with.He was given such an unstable start to life by bickering, neglectful parents who appeared to be unwilling to put their children's welfare first. This obviously had a massively detrimental impact on his self-esteem and sense of security, leading to an intense fear of abandonment. Hence his preference for duping his victims into spending time with him and then incapacitating them so he could enjoy their company without that fear of rejection. That way he could exercise total control over their lifeless bodies and indulge in his fetishes to his heart's content without contest.I expect he sank to unimaginable depths of depravity during those private moments, searching for the unachievable, ever-fleeting sense of fulfilment and satisfaction that he desperately wished to hold on to and savour.I've read quite a lot about Dahmer online, watched a number of interviews and the brilliant film 'My Friend Dahmer'. Evan Peters portrays him with a seemingly effortless and convincing performance that is heavily nuanced and intensely creepy. He absolutely nails the flat affect, monotone voice and distinct lack of emotional expression typical of most psychopaths.He really conveys the emptiness Dahmer had in his soul; the numbness, subdued anger and sexual frustration which engulfed him. He truly embodies Dahmer and was perfectly cast in this role.Technically speaking this series is very well researched, skilfully put together and held my undivided attention throughout. The acting by the whole cast, especially Richard Jenkins as Lionel, is first class. The tone is pitched perfectly for such a grim and sordid story. The directors create numerous moments of highly suspenseful and tense drama including some horrifying, darkly-intimate and cringe-inducing scenes, but these are needed to tell the story of Dahmer's debauchery in full.Episode 6 \"Silenced\" in particular is an exceptional and highly original piece of screenwriting with some of the most absorbing television I've seen for a long time. It was like a mini-masterpiece of melodrama.I really feel the writers got inside the mind of Dahmer, not only giving us the facts of what happened but allowing us to feel what it was like to see things the way he did. There are a number of minor adjustments or expansions to the narrative, but equally some omissions in order to make the content more palatable for the viewer. None of this affects the credibility of the series in my opinion as we are given ample opportunity to form a mental image of what happened from the point of view of all parties concerned.Despite having read up on the subject matter beforehand, and knowing how the events of his life unfolded, this excellent series has a real edginess and provides a fresh, unflinching and comprehensive account of the disturbing life of Jeffrey Dahmer.If like me you're fascinated by how a monster like Dahmer is formed, you're in for a real treat."},{"id":"rw8569631","title":"A sad account, in every sense of the word, particularly however, with the liberties it takes.","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"26 September 2022","text":"While Evan Peters certainly deserves accolades for his particularly engrossing and gripping personification of the monster that was Dahmer, the series - the first half of which was excellent - leaves much to be desired.Note: A special mention should also be made of actor Shaun Brown who delivered a stellar performance in his portrayal of Tracy Edwards, Dahmer's last would-be victim.Like a good book that you just do not want to put down and which leaves you wanting to know what the next page will bring, the first episode of \"Dahmer, Monster\" is compelling enough that if you have the time, you will not even think about turning off episode two.The issues, for me, began around episode 5. This is when the story began to move away from Dahmer and his actions somewhat, and began to concentrate on other aspects of the case and the people who surrounded him. This disconnect just grew and grew into the ensuing episodes, with Dahmer being present, less and less. While some viewers may not have minded this, and perhaps viewed it as being 'thorough', to me, it was fluff and fill. There's is no convincing me that this series would not have benefitted from being two episodes shorter. In fact, you could turn it off at episode 6, and could truthfully say you saw it in its entirety, ...or at least all its best parts."},{"id":"rw8558731","title":"Disturbing but good","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"21 September 2022","text":"This is definitely the best portrayal of Jeffery Dahmer I've seen. Evan Peter's was great in this. Eat your heart out Jeremey Renner. No pun intended. It's about time someone made a mini-series about Dahmer's life. Mostly because this psychopaths story is way too intricate to squeeze into a two hour film. The 2002 Jeremy Renner film was terrible and the 2017 film My Friend Dahmer didn't do the story much justice. This show gets into much more detail. I had no idea his mother was on tons of psychological medication while she was pregnant. Or that she was a suicidal UFO nut. I never knew he spent time in Germany as a US Army combat medic. A lot of the events that took place were news to me. I'm glad I decided to check this show out.

Especially Evan Peters does an awesome job. It's exciting to see the horrible story of JD staged so carefully. Would have been an 8 but the last two episodes focus too much on JDs neighbour Glenda Cleveland. She surely suffered a lot when JDs crimes were discovered but 15 people had been killed whose friends and families certainly suffered a lot more. I think those people deserve more attention than a lady that indeed did a good job but was not involved in the matter so much. That's why the last episodes are a little bit slow moving. All in all worth a watch."},{"id":"rw8573734","title":"Fell off a woke cliff","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"28 September 2022","text":"Dahmer's story has been told many times simply because we are horrified and fascinated by what he did in equal measure. His story is also part of the great debate about nature vs nurture and what has to happen to someone to turn them into a monster. This series started off so well as we delved into this very issue. The first 6 or 7 episodes were compelling but then something happened, as though the director suddenly chickened out. Later victims and Dahmer's experiments with injecting his victims in the brain to create a zombie he could control, were completely ignored. A relationship with one of his victims was invented and an occupant of his apartment block was invented. Then suddenly and for no apparent reason, the whole story stopped being about a serial killer and became all about civil rights with it being suggested that Dahmer's motivation was racist. Dahmer was many things but he was an equal opportunities killer. He chose victims because he found them beautiful and the colour of that person was not his concern. I don't understand why the series suddenly went down this cul-de-sac. Yes, he could have been caught earlier if the police had done their job but that is a different story about institutional racism in the USA and nothing to do with Dahmer, his actions or motivation."},{"id":"rw8747086","title":"This had me on the edge of my seat the whole time in a bad way!","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"20 December 2022","text":"The way that this was handled was prefect, there was no glorification of the violence that some series allow. This was a story driven decent into his life where no one can feel sorry for him. We see all moments from his younger ages to his worthy death in prison which is only the second murder we actually see play out on screen.With so many series that center around serial killers the murders are at the forefront just to satisfy a certain audience. Much like Mindhunter and also the fictional Hannibal the story is well written and completely grounded to be true to the victims. There were moments of shouting at the Tv on how did he get away with so much for so long. Which throws so many questions at law enforcement during this time.The acting performance from Peters is one of these that should be herald as one of the greatest in tv for being so like the real like person but not the way that quite a few people were reacting during the height of the series popularity. Just goes to so some people are weirdly drawn to serial killers.Overall this is one of the great depictions of a serial killer totally up there with the mindhunter actors!"},{"id":"rw8586896","title":"Yet another sad sad attempt by Hollywood to revise history","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"4 October 2022","text":"Well made?

What bother me about this series is it tries tooo hard to create storylines that just aren't true. If Murphy wants to delve into true-life crime then he needs to work on not taking such EXCESSIVE liberties, especially when choosing someone who is so well documented.There are so many inconsistencies to the truth here. I understand peppering a narrative with some extra drama to keep it interesting but this is beyond that to me. By the 7th or so episode it just got to be too much, although I did finish the series. The most compelling episode to me was the episode with Tony. Its a shame more time was not spent on the victims.I believe real true-crime fans would have preferred a more realistic approach to this story. If you want to embellish I to this extent, create your own serial killer and base him off Dahmer.

The last few after his capture felt very rushed and biased with Jeffrey not depicted accurately at all. It was like they got tired and dropped the ball. Watch all the interviews of Dahmer on YouTube and you'll see how they depicted him in prison in the series is nothing like how he really was then. They kept trying to portray him as evil and sleazy even though he was not and was repentant (he was found not to be a psychopath when tested, and even his doctors were genuinely sad to hear of his passing). As a psychology student, Dahmer has always fascinated me for the uniqueness of his psychology and how he wasn't truly evil like other serial killers, just incredibly sick.The thing that made me want to turn the show off was how they just had to stick in the rumor of Jeff taunting prisoners with food. That is completely untrue, it was a statement made by Scarver (his killer) when he was trying to get a book deal. Originally Scarver had said God told him to kill those inmates, and he also killed someone else at the same time. It had nothing to do with taunting. Also, according to Patrick Kennedy, Jeffrey had been in isolation for his own protection the entirety of his sentence until he finally asked to be released into general population even though he said he knew he would probably be killed there. And at least one officer who worked at the prison said Jeffrey was a model inmate on his way to medium security for good behavior. Inaccuracies like this are predictable but irritating.

She lived a building away. Her daughter never went to jail for breaking the white kids camera, the cops were never accused of being racist, the cops never called and did prank calls to the chinese guy, and so many other things they added for propganda value that never happened.The police were obviously negligent and deserved to be stripped of their duties but to assume they were racist is just speculation at that.

In my view, the ugliness of the police is equal to the evil of Dahmer.A standing ovation to all involved in this production as every aspect is sheer excellence.Be prepared to binge this whole series in one sitting!

Glenda Cleveland didn't even live in the building. She lived across the street. They could have written the character to be the real person who loved next door to Damher, Pamela Bass.Likewise, the Sinthasomphone family wasn't even at Dahmer's sentencing for molesting their son/brother, so the fact that the scene was depicted the way it was is entirely inaccurate.Lastly, although the officers in reality did not handle anything with this case well, the two officers were not named as \"officer of the year\".

We know about Dahmer, of course (one of the greatest performances in history by Evans Peters), but also about his victims, their families, his neighbours (so great Niecy Nash!), his parents (Jenkins...damn!), the awful cops, all the media circus...a great and complete limited series that can be the definitive work about this evil human being.I understand some of the critics, but I believe the pros - mainly showing this in a scary way to all the new generations and also highlighting the black community as the main victims - are way more important than any kind of sensitivity."},{"id":"rw8566529","title":"Another Propaganda Piece Ruins True Crime Story","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"25 September 2022","text":"Dahmer- one of the most hated, prolific of serial killers in history.

Every actor was amazing. I'm so impressed with this series.I never knew how white privilege the whole situation was with Dahmer.

Evan Peters is very good playing the title role. No campy stuff here, just plays Dahmer completely convincingly and serious.Makes effective use of flashbacks to Dahmer's childhood and teen years to explain how he turned out the way he did.Richard Jenkins plays Dahmer's father. He's great as a man broken by years of unhappiness culminating in realization of what his son has become. Penelope Ann Miller is wonderful in her short role as Dahmer's unstable, UFO-chasing mother.Niecy Nash has a small role as Dahmer's next-door neighbor. Her scenes are some of the most terrifying and unsettling, not for what you see, but for the sounds she endured. Love her in this role.The acting is pretty good across the board. The actors playing his victims were perfect at conveying terror. Shaun J. Brown plays Tracy Edwards, a victim, in the first episode. The scene had me on the edge of my seat. Without going into detail, the scene takes place mainly in Dahmer's apartment.Everything has a very dirty look to it, low lit, hazy. You could almost imagine the \"smell\" of the scenes. As horrible as that sounds, it does make for effectively creepy watching.Again, the subject matter is very dark and hard to endure. The series takes viewers from Dahmer's childhood up through his trial and imprisonment. I felt like Evan Peters completely inhabited his role. Also left me low with immense sadness for the families of the real-life victims, the survivors of his crimes, and the neighbors and others whose lives are left scarred by the actions of Dahmer the Monster."},{"id":"rw8560798","title":"TOTAL BINGE WORTHY","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"22 September 2022","text":"The story of one of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, largely told from the points of view of his victims. Being a fan of creepy thrillers and the horror genre I had to binge watch the entire 10 episodes each running 60 minutes. Ryan Murphy scores big on this one and is forgiven for some of his stinkers.Evan Peters as Dahmer is totally intensely creepy that I had to keep the lights on while watching. It is amazing how he can play any character tranforming himself. Niecy Nash as the concerned nosey neighbor deserves an Emmy for her role. The rest of the cast are superb as well.Make sure your doors are locked,the lights are on and you order enough food and drinks if you plan to binge watch this as I did."},{"id":"rw8592587","title":"Excessively dramatic and underwhelming","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"6 October 2022","text":"Like most Ryan Murphy projects, this one is also very messy and all over the place. It tries to be many things at once and ends up being ineffective and way too melodramatic. It attempts to depict true crime and horror and blend them into one, but fails to do so. The script takes many liberties that ultimately don't pay off and the social agenda behind it all is overblown. The dialogue is exaggerated and unnatural, very much in the style of Ryan Murphy. The series starts off strong, but later episodes seem extremely rushed and weak. Character performances are very captivating, especially Richard Jenkins, who is the high point of the series, even though Evan Peters is also admirable."},{"id":"rw8566942","title":"Look dad!

After all it is a disgusting and disturbing story, to say the least.I can say it was mostly done with a modicum of decency. The gore and violence was kept to a minimum.It was a decenct show until episode 7. Then it became an excuse for people not involved to claim victimhood. The best segment was the background of the sweet young promising deaf man. I really was hoping this would be more like the Versace segment of ACS and focus on the victims.The police are damned if they do and damned if they don't, aren't they? If they'd have stuck their nose in too far they'd have been accused of harassing people based on race or sexual orientation. They are easy to blame instead of those committing carnage. I think most people in that particular building minded their own troubles and didn't want the law around. The police were told to lay off the gay community. Also, some say Gacywas racist because he only killed white guys.The acting was good. It was overlong though. It takes a stab at trying to make sense of how Dahmer became a monster. I don't think anyone will ever know. It did show Dahmer as a soulless automaton. Seems pretty accurate. I think this is why he couldn't hold anyone's attention and the reason he had no feeling for other humans. Some reviewers don't believe his personality could have attracted all those men. It didn't. It was the fact he was blonde. A status symbol. A trophy hookup.At least they didn't show scenes of vulnerable people suffering and begging for their lives."},{"id":"rw8605722","title":"Netflix once again twists all of the facts","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"12 October 2022","text":"Many facts are twisted in this poorly written and overly acted series. Every single episode is used to push racism. The character played by Niecy Nash does not live next door. In fact, she lived across the street. There's a scene on a bus that they're showing children throwing things at an African-American child. What did that have to do with the story of an obvious psychopath that turns into a serial killer??? The racist agenda is clearly the number one priority for this series. Even though, Dahmer clearly killed whites and other minorities, they make this series about racism against the African-American community only. Another twisted fact, the deaf victim never had a relationship with Dahmer. He was lured into Dahmer's apartment the same way as many of his other victims, by offering money for taking pictures. This would have been a much better show if they had actually stuck with the facts."},{"id":"rw8581787","title":"Why Glenda Cleveland?","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"1 October 2022","text":"The show was good and well acted but Glenda Cleveland was given more screen time than any of Dahmer's victims yet she never lived next door to Dahmer, in fact, she didn't even live in the same apartment. So why on a show that aims not to tell the events from Dahmer's point of view did they chose to mainly focus the POV on a woman who had barley anything to do with him? Could it be she is now dead and they don't need her permission to take creative liberties in pushing agendas that (according to reporters at the time) weren't an issue? If so, this means they can't have Glenda herself dispute these claims as she is no longer with us and the victims (who mostly still are) claim to have never been reached out by Netflix for their permission on the show.

Instead a scene that could last 10 seconds is protracted to 50. Many scenes and themes are repeated 4-6 times and I kept screaming 'Again?!'Second is the annoying practice that filmmakers overdo these days: jumping in time a hundred times, backward and forward, forward and backward. It was nauseating overkill in this show.Third, many scenes are just unnecessary. They do not add any value or clarity. Taken out, they wouldn't leave gaps in the story.Starting in e4 thru to the end, I kept fast forwarding to move the story along.

The only good reason to watch this is to see Richard Jenkins' performance as Dahmer's father, because it's some incredible acting.The show itself is so... confused. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. On one hand it's trying to appeal to true crime fans that want to watch and hear about the most lurid and disgusting stuff imaginable. It wants to be a show about the philosophical implications of a person like Dahmer even existing. It wants to talk about the psychological conditions that bring about people like him. And it wants to do some social commentary about the police, racial issues.As you can imagine, it does none of this, because it doesn't have a focus. So what you've got is the first half that just feels like a personal story of Dahmer's, and the second which is like some boring, cliched drama about the families and the fallout of what's happened.As other reviews were asking, what is the purpose of this story? Was it to cover Dahmer? That's been done before, and it's not like it appeals to such a huge audience. Was it to explore philosophical questions of good and evil or maybe talk about policing issues in some places? Probably way better cases you could work with if that's your intent.The reason I'm giving it a 5 rather than a 7 is because the moral messages this show conveys aren't just twisted, they're also hypocritical. It celebrates Dahmer's death at the hand of some lunatic as if that's some great deed. It tries to say that it's a bad thing that some stupid comic featuring Dahmer wasn't banned, even as this show VERY GRATUITOUSLY depicts the killing of his real victims. Like, what?... It's pretending to be this respectful quasi-documentary that's imparting valuable lessons when it's anything but. It's damning what a hubristic view these creators have of themselves.Should you watch this? Not really. Any scenes worth your time will probably be on Youtube, and the whole package is not worth the 10h investment. There's nothing to learn here and nothing to gain."},{"id":"rw8598356","title":"Like Dahmer, Netflix just can't help themselves","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"9 October 2022","text":"This started off as an incredible miniseries that had me on the edge of my seat. The first episode sets the tone perfectly by luring the viewer into the mind of Dahmer through the experience of a victim. Evan Peters does an incredible job at portraying Dahmer, everything down to voice and mannerism is so well-acted it's borderline creepy.The show manages to portray the gruesome murders without being overly explicit about it, which in a way only adds to the physical discomfort you get from watching it. Instead of seeing blood you instead get to imagine it, which is way more scary. Combined with being beautifully shot and acted, you feel as if you're almost there seeing the real Dahmer himself hunt down and kill his victims.Unfortunately the show reaches some sort of blind alley from Episode 7 and forth, when the writers start to take too many liberties with the script. Up until that point the show felt very focused, grounded and straight to the point, but then all of a sudden it becomes a political story about discrimination, police incompetence and racial injustice where the writers hijack the story in order to send a message rooted in today's racial climate as of 2022. I mean, I wouldn't mind watching another show about those things but it felt incredibly forced, especially since Dahmer did not discriminate when it came to the color of his victim's skin - he didn't target black people or minorities, but the last four episodes is all about that which kind of ruins everything that came before. And I hate to break it but it's not just that interesting to watch through 1 hour of the victim's families sitting down talking about how miserable they feel. Most people watch these type of shows because they want to see inside the mind of the serial killer himself.It also doesn't help that a lot of the stuff in the last four episodes is made up, skewed or deliberately pushed aside in order to fit the \"message\" that the writers wanted to shove down our throats. What a shame. This could've easily been a 10/10 show if it wasn't for the fact that Netflix, just like Dahmer himself, just can't help themselves."},{"id":"rw8595772","title":"Felt the movie got hypocritical towards the end....","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"8 October 2022","text":"And I didn't want to be a hypocrite, myself.

The series imho was pretty darn good but I had to choose the latter action for myself. I had heard recently on the radio that many of the victim's families were upset about this series. That old wounds were being reopened and were painful. I felt a little toiled, but it's informational, right.? But as I saw the series unfold, I noticed that the narrative was starting to show the pain of the victim's families and how they were unable to escape their nightmare..... mostly due to people somehow trying to make a buck off the situation. That's exactly what this series itself was doing. After doing further research on the family's reactions to this, it didn't feel right to continue watching the final episodes."},{"id":"rw8604503","title":"Slaps Victims Loved Ones in the Face","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"12 October 2022","text":"If this was review was just about the performers, it would get a 10. I watched it because I like true crime. I enjoy seeing how murders are investigated and how murderers are brought to justice. If that had been the focus, I might have rated this more highly. I had heard that the victims' families were upset by this mini-series, and now I know why. It's one thing to make a documentary about a murderer that discusses what happened and how the murderer was caught. It's another thing to re-enact these events in an often disturbing fashion. The question a filmmaker needs to ask him/herself is \"why? Why should I make this film? Will it add anything to our knowledge of this subject and perhaps, in doing so, help us know more about how to prevent such things? I found this film to be gratuitous in its depictions of violence and sex. To make matters worse, the film is misleading in that it depicts events that never happened. Filming a true story often involves making up dialogue that no one can accurately reproduce, but this fictionalizes entire situations, such as making the character of Glenda Cleveland, Dahmer's next door neighbor who keeps complaining about the smell (of dead, dismembered victims) coming from his apartment, as well as sounds of people being hurt or killed. She reportedly placed over 50 calls to the police, most of which went unacknowledged. However, in reality she lived in the apartment building next door, and so could not have done much of what was attributed to her in the film. Quite honestly, this brings into question much of what the movie depicts. The film also depicts much racism and homophobia, particularly within the police department. While that may be accurate, it is difficult to know. Anyway, my three stars for this are for the performances. Otherwise, I think this mini-series is gratuitous in its depiction of sex and violence, and irresponsible in its many falsehoods."},{"id":"rw8565274","title":"What went wrong","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"24 September 2022","text":"The first half of this show was very intriguing I really enjoyed it,it was skin crawling creepy and had me looking away from the tv in some parts as it portrayed dahmer for the sick twisted individual he was,evans did a good job playing dahmer and his father in the series also played a great part with great acting but then the second half of the story turns into typical Netflix political agendas,racism and police corruption is the topic of the final 4 episodes of this series which really spoils the show and I struggled to finish it off.why must shows have to tread this line is beyond me there was no interactions with the families of the white men damher killed and the show just made it out that everyone white was racist even the serial killer 🙄 Netflix should of just made season 3 of mindhunter I'm honest a great show they killed off just when it had us all on the edge of our seats."},{"id":"rw8569827","title":"From pretty good to leftist propaganda.","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"26 September 2022","text":"This show started off well.

It's true that the police made some horrible mistakes, but of course Netflix had to portray some pure evil white cops.And the last two episodes get totally ridiculous. They make a charicature of the christian faith. No pastor would ever say 'congratulations, your sins are forgiven' after you're baptized. 'cause that's not what baptism does. Yes, it symbolizes it. But if you don't believe that Jesus died for you, then there's no forgiveness of sins. So, this show is kind of ridiculing the christian faith by telling that Dahmer just gets his peace with God for going down in a bath.And then there's the killer of Dahmer.. man..

Just tell the story accurately, so someone can watch this ten years from now and this would still feel relevant.I'm not sure why Netflix can't just produce a historically accurate series.

Do not believe those 1star and similar reviews and those making quick judgement after watching 1 episode.

The only true thing was the complaint about the smell and this actually came from a man and his wife. But they never did anything and for sure never called the police for anything. The show was good until there. It is disappointing that show runners always feel like they have to invent stuff to pump it bigger, by creating a fictional female character that never existed in the real events. Great acting but not accurate. Also when you just watch the interviews with Dahmer that exist on YouTube, you'll see that he is not talking the way he is portrayed. But it is in general still better as I expected, since I find it weird anyway to make films and shows about such horrific things.

To start off I'd have to give credit where it is due. It was a very well produced series with excellent performances, but at the same time I was conflicted watching it. Even before they exposed the sick people who became fans of him in the later episodes I wondered why I was watching this to begin. There's something wrong with giving all of this fame and glory to this evil lunatic. Unlike many others I've read in the reviews I didn't feel sympathy for him for one second. There are many individuals in this world with sick fantasies and poor upbringings who don't go on to do what he did.On the other hand I do think it is valuable to learn the history of these types of events as the show particularly did a good job highlighting the systemic flaws that allowed this flame to become a blazing forest fire. I did check the truth behind much of the series and it does do a good job in this respect as well.Overall, of any series I've ever watched this is definitely one that I couldn't and would never watch again. I learned stuff I didn't know which was valuable , but I hate that these kinds of people live on infamy through productions like this."},{"id":"rw8604657","title":"I really wanted to like this but...","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"12 October 2022","text":"First of all, Evan Peters is an amazing actor, and if his character wasn't based on a real person this would have been phenomenal. However, I feel the creators did a great injustice by the way they portrayed Dharmer. It comes off as if he was some insecure, sombre, loner when in reality he was a manipulative, confident and calculating sociopath.It's as if the creators almost want to depict Jeffery Dhamer as being a misunderstood outcast who can't bare to be alone, but the reality was that Dhamer lacked any kind of remorse or empathy for his victims and treated human beings like objects to satisfy his grotesque desires. The real kicker, however, is that the creators didn't even bother to contact a single family member of any victim, re-traumatising them in this process. For a show that claims to 'strive to put the victims' stories and their families' trauma at the heart of the production' they sure have a funny way of showing it. Jeffrey Dhamer is not a brand, he doesn't deserve a narrative.If maybe the creators took inspiration from Dhamer's life instead of trying to retell the story in a way that made Dhamer some kind of victim himself, this would have made for a much better series."},{"id":"rw8975392","title":"Haunting and chilling look at a terrible and emotional torn real life monster","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"6 April 2023","text":"I'm a fan of Ryan Murphy as his works are real and dig raw and it feels like madness, as he shows the grit and dirty like happenings of raw real life stories so well(evidenced by \"American Crime Story\", \"Impeachment\", \"American Horror Story\", and \"Feud\": Beatty and Joan\"). So with this special \"Netflix\" limited series \"Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" it was raw, blunt, and brash in it's showcase of one crazy real life monster in serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer(the wicked and good Evan Peters). The murder scenes are brutal and very blood like with nightmarish gore. Still along the way aside from the horror this series goes in depth and in detail about Jeff's troubled life and upbringing that lead him to be a monster, as shown are his being from a broken home, and his early love for road kill, which would all shape his different lifestyle on the Milwaukee streets which involved encounters at bars and bathhouses, after his exile from Ohio, and the military after his bored south Florida stay, in which Jeff passed some time working, staying with grandma, drinking beer and orange crush soda aside from his other strange hobbies. It's like a real life like bio of a serial killer, and you the viewer feel the pain of the victims families, and Jeff's father Lionel(the good Richard Jenkins) suffers the sorrow and heartbreak of what his grown son Jeffrey has become. Overall this was a tough brash series that grips your interest while you witness the difference of one Jeffrey and all while feeling the pain of the victims and their families."},{"id":"rw8561964","title":"Holy Moly!","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"22 September 2022","text":"Holy moly this was intense, creepy, disturbing and terrifying from the start to the finish. Based of course on the true Jeffery Dahmer case of kidnapping, murder and cannibalism.Evan does a very convincing and disturbing job playing Jeffery Dahmer. His looks and demeanor, the way he talks and even moves is just disturbing. Absolutely convincing and all around terrific job playing this role. Absolutely stunning performance.The writing and production are top notch and professional and even the simple music is haunting and matches the story and scenes.The rest of the cast is very competent and talented and play their roles very well. But Niecy Nash steals the spot for best female performance. Brilliant and emotional.All around I would say watch it."},{"id":"rw8566150","title":"Bad Seed","starRating":"","datePosted":"24 September 2022","text":"For the most part, I'll leave it to others to speculate, analyze, and dissect (no pun intended) what caused Jeffrey Dahmer to do what he did. Although his fractured home life certainly didn't help his already warped mind, I believe he was simply a bad seed. He wasn't a \"demon\" as the religious crazies have typically and absurdly claimed nor was it the fault of his distant and neglectful father or all the medications his mother took when she was pregnant with him. Monsters like Dahmer are born, and I don't think all the therapy and treatment in the world would have changed or helped him. Plenty of people are reared in dysfunctional households -- some much worse than Dahmer's -- but they don't grow up to become serial killers who eat their victims. Perhaps it was a combination of things in his life that created a monster, but I will always believe he was born bad. Although a good, long, hard spanking usually benefits most bad boys -- my husband insists that my spankings help to make him a better person -- nothing would have helped Dahmer except maybe a lobotomy.Evan Peters (some here have written \"Peter Evans\") gives an engrossing and memorable performance as Dahmer in which he perfectly captures Dahmer's demeanor and personality. He definitely deserves an Emmy as does Richard Jenkins."},{"id":"rw8558785","title":"Evan the Dahmer","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"21 September 2022","text":"I'm on episode 2 evan peters he's a real serial killer.

I think he's a terrific actor but I don't really feel like his portrayal of Dahmer was all that great. One of the scariest things about Dahmer was how intelligently and articulately he described his own crimes. The real Dahmer was soft-spoken, but self-aware and charismatic enough to manipulate people but Evan Peters portrayed him as completely monotone and emotionally flatlined. Maybe that's what people expect of someone who's done these kinds of crimes, but it wasn't how he actually was. There are many online interviews where you can see for yourself. I'm sure it was a difficult role, but I feel like EP missed the mark and just played him as a generically non-emotive psycho.There are also a lot of inaccuracies; many other reviewers have listed them here so I won't bother repeating, but there was a definite narrative being presented that diverged from facts. The real story was intriguing and certainly horrifying enough to not have to make stuff up or editorialize it to a particular opinion, but that's Hollywood for you.All in all it was worth a watch, especially the first half where the inaccuracies were kept to the minimum and the history of JD's life is presented as events actually unfolded. There's a lot of time jumps that could be confusing if you aren't familiar with his story but that didn't really ruin it for me. What did ruin it were the later episodes where entire episodes are based on fabricated characters and events that are used to \"sell\" a particular narrative. Still it's the best and most detailed look at Dahmer and the horrible, shocking crimes he committed."},{"id":"rw8570670","title":"Tasteless and Unnecessary","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"26 September 2022","text":"I think it is tasteless and unnecessary to make shows like this about serial killers. The man brutally murdered more than a dozen people, why would you want to make a tv show about that?A horror movie is one thing because they are works of fiction, I can see how that makes for a thrilling story, but the difference is that this was a real killer with real victims and some of the families are still alive, how do you think they feel when a new tv show comes out about the man who killed someone they love (almost glorifying him) and it becomes the most popular show on Netflix? Have Netflix really sunk that low?It would be different if it was an informative documentary, something like a collection of interviews with criminal psychologists, police, and victim's family members if they were willing, don't glorify him in any way, but just talk about what he did and try to explain why he did these things, maybe something positive could come out of that because people could learn how these monsters are created and we could all try to make sure that stuff doesn't happen again, but this is just cheap heat, it shocks people (and it should) but that is not automatically a good thing.If they really wanted to make something like this then they should have made it about Jack the Ripper or other cases like that, because it happened so long ago that everyone involved has been dead for a very long time. So I'm sure this is probably well made as far as tv shows go, but I think it is very tasteless and unnecessary to make a tv show about this creep, and I think it is even sadder that it is currently number 1 on Netflix.

Would it kill Ryan Murphy to actually do some thorough research and stick to the source material. It's waaaay more compelling. Also, Evan Peters' one note monotone robotic performance is not realistic (combined with his brown eyes and dark hair). Watch the Dahmer family home movies. He came across as an unassuming nice regular Joe schmo. Maybe it's the writing and direction's fault but there are tons of interviews and trial footage to create from so why make up completely inaccurate scenes that discredit the victims true experience? It does a major disservice to the poor victims. I don't like that, especially considering the situation involving the 14 year old boy (character assassination) ALSO.: (The moment with the cops is almost accurate, but should have been handled differently). The Niecy Nash character didn't even live in the same building as him! Get out of here with this fictional mess.Yes, there are a tiny few solid moments and some of the production designs are spot on, but the inaccuraricies outweigh the few small good moments combined with a lot of boring filler and too many flashbacks. All in typical tasteless Ryan Murphy fashion (couldn't even think of an original title).

There are supposed to be at least two more series/seasons following the extreme success of 'Dahmer' although the subjects of subsequent seasons have yet to be revealed. The show stars Evan Peters as well known serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer as well as Richard Jenkins as his dad and Molly Ringwald as his stepmother. The series contains ten episodes that all were released at the same time which is the Netflix standard in September of 2022.This is nominally the story of the notorious life and violent death of Jeffery Dahmer who is one of the most famous serial killers in American history. The story starts with his apprehension in a rundown Milwaukee apartment in 1991 after one of his intended victims gets away from him and sends the police. Subsequently numerous gruesome and unsettling discoveries are made with regards to Dahmer. The show goes back and tracks Dahmer's early life and tries to piece together how he became what he became. He did not have a great family life, he was not very smart, he was not very social and developed a heavy drinking habit early on. We see all his failings leading to his first kill in Ohio and then years later as he fully embraces his dark nature and becomes a predator of gay minorities in Milwaukee. We see a few close calls as Dahmer comes precariously close to being caught on more then one occasion. Eventually though his luck runs out and he is marched off into infamy by police. It was good to see that there is time and attention given to at least some of the victims. Finally we are confronted with the death of Dahmer at the hands of an African American inmate which some may think of as a measure of poetic justice.I would never say that Dahmer was misunderstood. It is interesting, perhaps due to so many years passing, that the totality of his story is not fully grasped, or maybe hasn't been until now. I think for a lot of these high profile serial killers there are a few bullets that people know, but, for whatever reason, never learn the rest. I was a young teen when Dahmer was apprehended, and when he was subsequently killed in prison, but I don't think I had ever really gone through his story and that of his victims. I know there has been some controversy surrounding this show as the families have pushed back against this production that they see as dredging up negative memories and capitalizing on their pain. While I sympathize, to be fair, that is not a realistic way of looking at making popular media as then we would never get stories about the darker side of our human nature. A casual viewer may tune in to see a salacious expose of a notorious serial killer, and this show does do some of that to be sure, but what surprised me is how sympathetic it is towards the victims. There is a whole episode dedicated to one victim, a deaf man named Tony Hughes. Another victim highlighted prominently is that of 14-year old Konerak Sinthasomphone who actually managed to flee Dahmer and was handed back to him by police when Dahmer convinced them it was his drunk lover. A huge theme that develops in this show is that of race and how Dahmer was able to navigate a system that gave him, as a white man, the benefit of the doubt over and over again. Dahmer lived in a poorer Milwaukee neighborhood that was considered a \"bad\" part of town and was populated mostly by minorities. Most serial killers seem to be some level of intelligent as they continue to evade detection and hide their darker nature from family and friends. Jeffrey Dahmer is actually not very bright and it is through negligence, racism and sheer dumb luck that he eludes law enforcement as long as he did. Milwaukee is a notoriously racist city which is a battle that is still being fought decades later, and was an environment that Dahmer, the predatory monster, exploited. All this and more this show lays bare thanks to the creative team's deft hand as well as wonderful portrayals all around, most notably by Peters as Dahmer. This show elevates its notorious subject matter to a higher discussion platform rather than just being the latest glossy expose of the killer du jour. Creepy, haunting and meaningful Netflix's Dahmer makes for an enjoyable viewing some unexpected ways.Eric's Grade: A-"},{"id":"rw8635904","title":"Distasteful, horrendous garbage.","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"25 October 2022","text":"I don't care how much money is spent, I don't care how much effort the actors and crew who worked on this put in. This isn't some fictional character we're talking about, this was a real person, who really did horrendous things. And now you're going to make a production, complete with recreating these killings? That is disgusting. I watched two episodes with my family, it was horrible. I only understand the obsession with this type of stuff up to the point of trying to figure out how their minds worked. Anything beyond that is a complete mystery to me. But guess what, a production is not needed to find out how his mind worked, an article written, or a short documentary explaining these things would be far better. The point is to entertain? Who could be entertained by watching the recreation of a psychopath's killings? Someone who couldn't think: \"what if my child, my brother, my nephew, were murdered and their body brutally desecrated, and the person who did it gets a TV show made about them where the killing is recreated?\" And I heard in many of the reviews that certain parts of what happened were changed to make a political statement even though it alters facts, that makes it even worse if true.

The show has an anti police narrative that exaggerates the knowledge everyone had of Dahmers crimes with the police doing nothing about it. The police certainly messed up bringing the child back to Dahmer but the neighbor (and others) in real life were not as self aware of what was going on as they were in the show. She did not know Dahmer was killing people and the show makes it seem like she told the police of that multiple times and they did nothing about it. I did not like how the show continuously pressed on that. Glenda Cleveland didn't even live next door to Dahmer in real life, she was way too relevant in the show.

You know, something that effect. However, what we discover early on, is that it is a story that blatantly lies to you over and over, makes up it's own characters and events and how they happened and turns it into another Netflix Lifetime movie.

Where are their stories? How do we remember them if the highlight is always the killer? This is where Episode 6-10 comes in. As it focuses more on the victims, Glenda, his family and, not him. Would've given this show a 10 if they actually did this for all the episodes. Giving actual highlight to all his victims... their lives, their dreams...before all of it was taken away. Really digging into the blatant bias and racism of the police because those are looked over and this is a chance to expose it. I guess at the very least they actually showcased part of it.Now the first 5 episodes weren't bad at all. They didn't make Dahmer some romantic person. Evans really did great. He's creepy and scary and just overall made me want to remove him from the screen. I also applaud that they didn't overly glorify the killings. We got some scenes of death and gruesomeness but there was no blatant torture porn and rape where they focus on the victim's pain and anguish during their last moments just to make really disrespectful audience grab.For other things, it's a slowburn type of telling. It's a cruise basically. There's no pouncing action in here. I like the ost choice as well. It's griping and fits the scenes especially during tense moments. It also doesn't overwhelm you.

Is as much an in-depth psychological examination of the prolific serial killer - his upbringing, his relationships, his desires and behaviors - as it is a graphic, unsparing, intimate, highly tense, and disturbing Netflix series. I feel disgusted, disturbed, intrigued, fascinated, and invested all at the same time. Much of the show's success is due to engrossing performances, particularly by Evan Peters in a disquieting turn as Jeff Dahmer and Richard Jenkins as his hard-ass father Lionel. Layer upon layer, the confounding character study unfolds by taking the viewer to different time periods in non-linear fashion throughout Jeff's life, setting the stage with his capture and interrogation. I only wish the pacing was a little faster sometimes, but the slow burn often increases the anxiety through anticipation and dread. The show also looks great capturing a retro and seedy atmosphere and the details of several locales from the 70s through the 90s. If you're fascinated by serial killer studies, then this is a must-watch, but if you are squeamish, then look away.

It hits all the main story beats quite well and the acting and direction are really top knotch. However, there is quite a bit that is completely inaccurate, or never even happened in the first place. It practically lends a hand at making Dahmer a movie monster, instead of being a biopic about him, i.e. Glenda not even living in the same building or being the one who discovers the 14 year old boy on the street, the fact that his dad never participated in or drove around and helped him pick up roadkill to practice his disections and taxidermy, the fact that he had a pretty normal childhood when compared to a lot of other people, the way some of his victims were killed, etc. That, in my opinion, is extremely disrespectful to the true story and to the victim's families. Makes me feel like this is exploitation at its worst. On the other hand, everyone does a bang up job, except Peters. Who again I feel is playing himself, just with a different style. For me, it just wasn't the transformation that everyone is raving about. Not to say he doesn't do a good job, I like the guy and love him on AHS, but I just can't see him as a serious actor in anything else. The direction was perfect for the series, and the writing feels genuine and authentic, minus the embellishments. I just still can't get over how exploitative this all feels, and how the families of the victims must feel about their tragedy being put up as a horror series, let alone have to see and hear about it everywhere they look. Had they added more of the victims and cut out some of the murderous stuff, like show us what happened without showing us what happened type of stuff, and if they had cared to stick to the facts, I might have liked this a bit better. As it stands though, I think the series is unnecessary, crude, inaccurate and disrespectful, regardless of how well it was made. The fact that so many people are rating this so highly is beyond me. If this had been released 20 years ago, it wouldn't have seen the light of day. Not because of the content, but because people would've cared enough about the families and realized this was disrespectful material. 1 deeply disturbed individual out of 5."},{"id":"rw8609436","title":"Not the full story","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"14 October 2022","text":"First of all I want to say that Evan Peters and Richard Perkins absolutely knock it out the park in this series, and to be honest, all the actors are great. There's things missed out on though which are maybe too heavy for the series but\nit's already heavy enough so why not if they're in the actual accounts confirmed. Why they made Tony's friend black is pointless as he is an actual bigger part of the story than shown. He was a big suspect in the disappearance of Tony and was realy given a tough time from the police. It also didn't tell the full details of what Dahmer done with his victims after killing them. The clarity of the timeline isn't great either. I have no problem jumping from 1989 to 78 then 91 for instance, but it's only shown what year it's bounced to a few times in this whole series and could be confusing to some.All in all I'd recommend it to friends but anyone who has seen \"Dahmer on Dahmer\" will know more details than given in this 50 hour series."},{"id":"rw8944408","title":"A little part of all of us is Jeffrey Dahmer.","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"22 March 2023","text":"I was wondering where I was going to finally start this review but now I know: according to the trivia section this was written with one rule in mind: it was not going to be from Jeffrey's point of view.Dude...if that was your goal, you failed UTTERLY!This is totally from his point of view. In fact, it feels desperate to make him into the most sympathetic character on screen. Perhaps that's an exaggeration but that was a reason why it took me a while to get round to writing this. I wasn't going to watch it because everyone was talking about it but I had too many direct word of mouth recommendations to not.Watching this was an odyssey into myself, sort of like Lionel and his own book. I'm not quite sure why I kept making excuses for him. What I saw was a portrait of an individual who, at least at first, was the victim of a callous culture. A better culture than most the world but still intolerant of queer people and where parents either will not or cannot speak candidly with their children.As we see the very mundane (in the good way) journey of Dahmer into darkness, it is easy to relate to someone who didn't identify well with people (and vice versa) and didn't harmonize with people's strict expectations. His story is one of alienation. It began as a life where he had basically nothing to get excited or passionate about and ultimately was cursed with this one thing that made life more than one long bore.This is the impression I got from the show. Of course this Jeffrey and real Jeffrey are different people and I have indeed demarcated them in my mind. This is the not the 100% dramatized documentary like Schindler's List or Boys Don't Cry, this feels like just another TV show (albeit a good one). You never forget that it's based on fact which helps with the non-linear (and often meandering) narrative a lot.Prudently, this sort of begins at the (almost end). We all know there's no real happy ending coming so we get that out of the way and then get straight onto humanizing child-Dahmer.It is a poignant and bleak tale that (regrettably) isn't above getting a bit sentimental once in a while. It's admirable that they focus on how Jeffrey's crimes are not just his crimes but those of society. Not just through police misconduct but in the culture we leave. He is ultimately liable, I must admit, but considering he gets exactly the punitive measures he deserves, it is difficult to hate this Jeffrey. Like a hurricane that takes many lives and then dissipates the feeling is not anger but a sense of profound tragedy tinged with fear.Shot with a eerie yellow filter, you get right in Jeffrey's head as an appreciate of the sensual and intimate and as someone who craved connection but couldn't stand the rejection potential of a sentient human.It's a lot less interesting when we are following anyone who isn't jeff. There's almost no really sympathetic characters hear. The subplot about bad police is pertinent and relevant to the story but was not that interesting to me even though I am part of that \"don't trust the police\" choir.I thought his neighbour was kind of annoying and obnoxious. Clearly in the right but that's not the point.Anyway, it's not a horror, but it's worth seeing."},{"id":"rw8883973","title":"Good acting but I can't recommend it","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"21 February 2023","text":"The acting itself is actually really good. Evan Peters really seems like a serial killer and I'm sure he portrayed Dahmer to a T. It was hard for me to watch though and I didn't get much entertainment out of it. I kind of feel like this glorifies him and what he did and usually I enjoy stuff about serial killers. It was also hard to see how inept the cops were and how they must have been in real life to let it go on for as long as it did. The neighbor Glenda Cleveland also became a bit annoying for me. She went through a lot and her cries for help went unanswered but after a while I just didn't care about her. It focused on her too much I feel really.

Telling the story of one of America's most notorious serial killers, Jeffrey Dahmer, the show depicts the gruesome details of his multiyear killing spree, where he took the lives of at least 17 men and boys.The show is narrated from the perspective of his victims providing an intimate and chilling view of Dahmer's crimes. The police incompetence and apathy that allowed him to go on with his murders are also highlighted along with Dahmer's clean-cut appearance, which often made it easy for him to get away with his heinous crimes.Evan Peters' portrayal of the twisted killer is nothing short of mind-blowing depicting Dahmer with ease and dark charisma. The unfolding of events is expertly depicted with superb acting by both protagonists and antagonists alike.While the show is light on gruesome scenes, the effects and visuals are masterful sending chills down your spine and \"sensing\" the feel and odor of decaying flesh laced with debilitating acidic vapors.It's a must-watch for horror enthusiasts who can handle all aspects of the story without being too disturbed by the subject matter."},{"id":"rw8581538","title":"Brilliant!","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"1 October 2022","text":"Wow!

While doing so, it also throws light on various societal issues because of which these murders continued to happen.BRILLIANT acting by the Evan Peters and several of the supporting cast, I won't be surprised if this one show sweeps away all of the awards.Parts of show aren't for the faint hearted, this will make you feel a certain way and you might have to take a break before you move on to the next episode.

How can they make ten one hour shows about this man? I read a biography of Dahmer several years ago and while the main points of this show are true, there's an awful lot of padding in there too. The show is slow, boring and lacks focus. It jumps around between time periods, one scene is Dahmer as a young boy, the next as a man, then back to being a young boy again.

There's plenty of detail and facts surrounding this entire case that are interesting and worthy of being portrayed, so I fail to see what exactly demanded such ridiculous story arcs that make no sense? This was incredibly loosely based on facts.Second- what is it with the obsession with dark, grainy, shaky cameras? It's not artsy or edgy and makes nothing more interesting. If anything it gives the feeling of nausea. Stop it. It wasn't good when it was first demonstrated, and no matter how many people use it with their own interpretation, it doesn't get better.Lastly, the victims are still victims. From all accounts, none ever egged him on, at least not in the manner in which the writers suggest- so much so that many victim's families are considering suits. I sincerely hope they're successful and Murphy can knock it off with his odd obsession with twists that make victims look stupid and like they're asking for it.If anyone in Hollywood even still cares what the average audience cares, listen to us when we tell you we've had our complete fill of Ryan Murphy- stop giving him money for nonsense."},{"id":"rw8575955","title":"A victims' pov true crime documentary with huge misconduct from creators","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"29 September 2022","text":"Essentially this series has two \"parts\" -a retelling of the well known horror (which is what you would expect) and harrowing tales of those that lived on, which isn't something that we usually see in detail. First part leaves you in fear and shock while the second makes you numb1) The \"what happened\" montage\nSo acting is top notch but I have the problem with overall tone of episodes. Firstly - it is too slow, movements, dialogues, music, zoom ins and outs. The creepy atmosphere is exaggerated. The scary part isn't titular monster being a walking red flag and staring at you, it's the fact that you don't know it's a monster until it's too late. Subtlety would've made this 10/10 since we know how this is gonna play out, we don't need every possible visual or musical cue to be on the edge. Would've preferred the chronological order of events2) The story of survivors is what made this exceptional and something I honestly didn't expect. Somehow it felt like I was there, alive at that time and place, staring in shock and dissappointment at the world until there was nothing. This would've been a great opportunity to collaborate with the families,\nto be their voice, to inspire people to do better but none of that happened. They apparently weren't consulted at all. Ironically, Netflix did the same thing people in charge did back then and completely ignored them making way for their own project. It poses a question - how ethical is the true crime genre if all we're doing is satisfying our own curiosity and making profits of destroyed lives? There always needs to be a reminder that this is real life and not entertainmentAs a mini series this gets 9/10, props to the actors, cons to extremely slow pace.

His wicked and twisted behaviour is well performed and \"just enough\" to want to turn it off because it's starting to be too much for a normal person to handle..but then suddenly...it isn't. I'd say the first few episodes sort of seem slow, but somehow they're not because it's so heavy...I carried on and am glad I did because the last few episodes take a different direction and there's more about other things going on and other sides to situations and victims.

After watching this series, I still cannot believe this actually happened, but know it did. My heart breaks all over again for these families. I saw in some reviews that people took exception to the light being shown on the police force at that time. But, I think it was needed & deserved. I totally respect the police & I am extremely appreciative of the difficult job they do. However, there are bad apples...and it is no secret that there are underserved communities. Jeffrey Dahmer could & should have been stopped sooner. I read that some of the families feel victimized all over again.

Lots of fluff and filler over the the actual story. There is so much in this series that can't possibly be true. Murphy decides to tell us more about Dahmers parents, early years, teen years and high school years. Things that he possibly couldn't know. It's all fiction and filler. Meanwhile you're taken away from what you came for, to learn about Dahmer the Serial Killer and his psyche. There is no real exploration in to that or the horror his victims endured. It's really just a fictional puff piece sprinkled with factual events. And Evan Peters was not the right actor for this. He's just too likeable. You may actually feel sympathy for Jeffrey Dahmer and at times see him as a victim himself. What an insult to the real victims and their families and the horrors they endured from this monster. Quantity over quality at ten episodes. That's the Netflix way. This could have been done effectively in four episodes and stick to the facts with much better actors and director.

Richard Jenkins delivered a fantastic performance (as usual) playing Dahmer's father. I like most of Jenkins' movies but here he shines as the guilt stricken father of the infamous serial killer. Without Jenkins however, this series would be unwatchable. Evan Peters also delivers a great performance as Dahmer. Now that that's out of the way, I'll get into the problems with the series which is the writing and the extreme and dishonest levels of \"artistic liberty\" the writer, director, and producers take on telling the story. In a nutshell, they took a true story and used it to push a very \"special\" narrative. We've seen this before, the police are a bunch of, well you know what they are. It's gotten so bad I don't even need to say it. And I don't wish to be hunted down by Biden's DoJ for posting a review. Also, the character who plays Glenda is almost more unlikable than Dahmer himself. She is his neighbor and for some reason half of the series is about her. My very first impression of her was positive but that quickly changes as she does nothing but scream and yell and complain about everything under the Sun. As for the \"artistic liberty\", if you watch this series, and I advise you not waste your time, just try to think outside of what your being fed.

This showcases how far people are willing to go for a dollar in the current age and I wish it would've ended here, but the Avengers-like cameos from other serial killers can guarantee you that more will come. Judging this as a piece of media, the actors did a good job with the material given. The jumbled timeline eliminated all suspense and ruined a narrative journey that a story should tell, even though most are already familiar with the unfortunate tale.

There are some common factual errors, but there's a lot that covers it, such as excellent performances from Evan Peters whose made to look just like the serial killer, as well as bloody fantastic work from supporting actors Richard Jenkins and Niecy Nash. The way this series tells Jeffrey Dahmer's story is incredibly unique and very admirable as well, by focusing on the killer's monstrous backstory and upbringing, the murder victims themselves and the loved ones or others surrounding the Jeffrey Dahmer case, all whilst frequently jumping back and forth in time. There is some really good tension in the first episode, followed by a later episode that's almost completely silent as it looks through the eyes of a deaf victim, and some very disturbing scenes that'll make you want to look away.

A guy so monotone, robotic and sleazy anyone with a brain would run the opposite direction...That's how Peters decided to play an actual non-fiction person, who was, indeed, a human monster, but the monster comes from what he did when he got what he wanted and was able to DO what he wanted...But the problem here is there's no character-arc for Dahmner... He starts out a droning freak and winds up the same way... As for his accent, it seems unnatural and put-on... performed...Meanwhile the pace doesn't flow; it's a real slog to get through.... There are so many interesting aspects of Dahmer's life to be studied, to experience, and yet the entire thing feels like it's deliberately slow-motion-arthouse-weird for the sake of style instead of substance...Through school, through the army, through gay bar hookups, through everything in Dahmer's entire life including interrogation, he's a one-dimensional cardboard-cutout of how a novice acting student would IMAGINE a crazy person to be...And many good reviews are noting how off-putting and creepy this is, but... if everything's off-putting, what's there to compare it with? In fact, most of the other characters, from his victims to bosses to the police and especially Richard Jenkins as his dad, are equally as stone-faced and drowsy...Overall, MONSTER is more like another chapter of American Horror Story instead of an actual serial killer biopic... and those can be amazing, but Ryan Murphy and his boy are too stuck in their usual pretentious rut to let an actual story (of an actual person) shine through."},{"id":"rw8567785","title":"Really Awful TV, This is bad for you!","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"25 September 2022","text":"If you're on the fence about watching this, just don't.

Evan Peters gives an unsettling and nuanced performance, and Richard Jenkins blows it out of the water as a horrified yet still devoted father. I could go on for paragraphs about the strength of the main characters in this show, in both portrayal and script. Although some of the victims' families take offense to this show existing, it is unfortunately part of the territory when you're attached to shocking events, and I felt this show was more respectful than most serial killer fare. Never does it stoop to exploitation or cheap shocks (many of the more gruesome details of Dahmer's crimes are omitted), and care is taken to portray the victims as real people with lives and families. Dahmer himself is not one-dimensional, but neither is he really sympathetic. The show avoids trying to explain why he is the way he is, which I really appreciated.It is to be expected that liberties will be taken with these real events to condense things, provide better pacing, etc. Most of the changes I thought were fine. Where things began to kind of go off the rails was around episode 6 or 7. After Dahmer's arrest, the show begins to focus heavily on the court proceedings, race relations, and the domestic drama of the grieving families, the latter two delving into straight fiction. At the risk of sounding callous, I found it boring. I don't care that a victim's mother took umbrage at a tasteless comic starring Dahmer and mounted a lawsuit. Dahmer was a killer of opportunity and did not go out of his way to kill minorities, nor did he specifically choose a minority neighborhood to live in. The police did not ignore tips/warning signs about Dahmer because the neighborhood was mostly black, but because of homophobia (an actual issue the show could have explored more). I do not believe cops were making racist crank calls to victims' families, and the man who killed Dahmer was a raving lunatic who murdered someone for $15, not the righteous hand of justice.Would have been an 8/10 or 9/10 without the drop in accuracy and quality post-episode 7.

This show is a special one, there is so much attention to detail! I've seen all the movies that have been released about Jeffrey Dahmer but none was as good, as accurate and as passionate as this show. Peters was absolutely convincing as Jeffrey Dahmer, giving some extraordinary performances. What you will see in the show is not a 100% accurate but most things are actually based on the real events, which makes the show much more intense, brutal, tragic and dramatic, sometimes you will get a horror vibe. This show is not for everyone, only adults who can stomach this kind of theme should watch it!While there is pretty much no gore in the show it still is very dark and many times it will make you feel sick, to me responsible for that is mostly Evan Peters and his performance but all the other actors do an amazing job as well. Many shows and movies have tried to get inside the head of a monster/psychopath but they fail. Well this show actually did it successfully! You will feel like you are inside Dahmer's head, you will be able to see the world the way he sees the world. Evan Peters proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time.

Sure, we get their stories, but their inner personalities, lives, dreams and motivations in life are never really known.It's very well done, yes hard to watch, but masterfully directed (four episodes of Season One were directed by Jennifer Lynch). Niecy Nash, always superb, plays Glenda Cleveland, one of Dahmer's neighbors who (in vain) begged the cops to investigate bizarre screams, buzz saws, and the stench coming from Dahmer's apartment. As her character states, \"For years I told you to do something and you did NOTHING.\" Nash is simply superb in this role.Stories are told from at least 10 instances where this monster was nearly caught but time after time, released. Inept cops and judges that give him a pass are simply astounding. So if the father, who makes everything about him.As always, Richard Jenkins delivers a perfect performance (as the senior Dahmer) Molly Ringwald, Penelope Ann Miller and Michael Learned skillfully play other Dahmer women.Once again, we have another story of police not being held accountable. The ineptitude of cops and judges is shocking."},{"id":"rw8641070","title":"A monster whose story was famous but this attempt is not gonna be","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"28 October 2022","text":"10 episodes seem too long for his story, I guess. Especially, when he kills young men and eats them in almost all the stories. It could easily have been cut short to 4-5 episodes. But Evan Peters acted wonderfully. He truly acted like a monster, his dialogue delivery carried a good weightage. The screenplay is too slow but the performance was outstanding makes this limited webseries swing between good and bad. Some scenes were not watchable to be honest. The blood, bone, arteries and the heart, gosh, that was just too much.

Whether it be 48 hours, or documentaries, biopics, you name it and i've probably watched it. That being said, I have yet to see something as jaw dropping and moving as this series right here. I am pretty numb to the brutality of all of these events because i've read about them or seen them portrayed so many times in different variations of media, so it is very rare for something to actually evoke a sort of emotion out of me.Evan peters' portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer is the best I have ever seen. I'm a fan of his work in previous projects (ahs, american animals, x men etc) so going into this I already knew I was in for a treat. But MAN. I genuinely became nauseous at the sight of the vicious acts displayed in this show, Ryan Murphy held back no punches, and I believe the show is better for it. The reality of what this sicko did is just beyond comprehension, and I truly believe that Evan and Ryan and the entire team involved have truly captured that. I am 4 episodes in as of now and am sitting in absolute shock.This is the first show I have actually had to take a break from, sit back and just let it soak in the true horror of what i'm witnessing. I'm no actor myself so I won't say I know what it takes to play a murderous psychopath like Dahmer, but I can't imagine it's easy. Kudos to the entire production team, Ryan Murphy, and Evan Peters.

I'm all for a little drama but this is just completely false.In the series opener, there is news playing about 5 white officers beating a black undercover officer. The Milwaukee Journal could not find any record of this event. Yet again, Netflix creating lies and a false racial narrative.Dahmer's father did write the judge a letter but he asked the judge to keep Dahmer locked up, not asking for him to be released or get a light sentence.I could go on and on since there are so many other parts that are fictional as well.

Additionally, Netflix could have donated a significant portion to relevant charities, but they didn't.Teenage me would have found this interesting. However, adult me - who has witnessed dying and the aftermath of violent deaths - can only feel truly heartbroken for the victims' family members.

We all know mental illness is a thing, we all know bad parenting is bad. We don't need a necrophile cannibal to teach us. While people like Jeffrey Dahmer should simply be forgotten, not only does the show remind the world he existed (I'd never heard of him before), but it goes as far as making him look like the victim. Almost as if you, the viewer, should feel guilty for being part of that same society that made him who he was.To add insult to injury, the victims' real names weren't changed, and it appears that the victims' families weren't even notified about the show's production, let alone asked for permission to use their names and likeness for a profit, which I think is borderline illegal.Just disgusting."},{"id":"rw8592851","title":"Lies upon lies typical for Netflix","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"6 October 2022","text":"My favorite character the \"neighbor\" did actually live next door nor did she even live in the same building!!

I watched this series and ended up feeling sorry for Dahmer. The word \"empathy\" fits here. Dahmer like all of us was born innocent. An innocent young boy who witnessed domestic abuse and the abhorrent abandonment by his mother (thus leaving the home available for his first kill). Before he killed and abused people, Dahmer, like us all, deserved love, warmth, kindness and understanding. His basic needs should have been met. He should have been encouraged. He needed friends, companionship and stability. He seemingly never had much of any of these. Even the people in his life whom were good to him (his father and grandmother) didn't understand him. This was a lonely, mentally unwell, empty and sad young man who couldn't relate to others. He was so terrified of people leaving him; he killed them. A happy and content person doesn't do this, do they?How and why do I feel sad for Dahmer after watching this show? Perhaps because I can empathise deeply with a person's situation. I know he was once a little boy. His life could have been so different. What on earth went so horribly wrong?Or did Ryan Murphy do this me? What was his motive? What did he want us to feel? Did he intend to make us feel bad for Jeff? If so, why?I was also an Evan Peters fan before watching this so perhaps I can't separate him from Dahmer.Regardless, just be careful watching this. I couldn't stop thinking about Dahmer afterwards. Searching, reading, non-stop interview watching.

It starts with Dahmer's arrest and then is told in a series of flash backs and forward to some of the events in the story, some covered more than once from slightly different points of view. While I quite liked this some people may find it a little confusing.Where the series looses points for me is that there is too much padding and repetition in many of the episodes making them drag. The series could have been cut down to 5 or 6 one hour episodes without loosing the story and it's impact and would have been far better.5 out of the 6 points I rated it are for the lead actors performances especially Evan Peters."},{"id":"rw8603744","title":"Dahmer is animal and not Saint Dahmer!","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"11 October 2022","text":"I was not going to watch this, because with Netflix nowadays there is a lot of woke garbage that always takes away from the film and this one did have some of the same thing oozing from it! First off, the acting was great... Evan Peters was sensational but it could not save the fact that the writers decided to make Jeffrey Dahmer the victim or as I dubbed him, \"Saint Dahmer.\" That made me sick to my stomach. I continued watching hoping something would change, but with every new show, Dahmer was made to be the victim. I can only imagine what the families felt that lost loved ones to this sick, vile, animal. When the last episode happened, I was thinking okay maybe they'll get the last scene right when Dahmer actually gets killed... but no! Again Saint Dahmer, \"He says something like I'm a born-again Christian and I found God\" or something like this. Even that scene Saint Dahmer. I kick myself for watching this. Peters was however, truly great, but this is more woke crap.... the criminals are always the victim in their serial killer world."},{"id":"rw8702982","title":"the woken cannibal","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"30 November 2022","text":"So I almost skipped this because after 2 episodes the story went into gumby mode. If they're getting paid by the video frames I get it but imo they could have produced this in half or a third of the celluloid. Seriously, never thought serial killing could be boring until watching this. Mr Peters is great at his craft and the resemblance is there but this is a fairly one sided character in shallow waters. Most of it is boiler plate, \"sorry dad\" stuff. But most annoying is the ham fisted message that dahmer wasn't caught because he was white. Little mister privileged serial killer who could have been caught so many times if he'd just been born with a different colored skin. I guess the producers never heard of kermit gosnell. How did this guy manage to run his \"house of horrors\" for so long and never get caught except executive privilege. And the producers never sat on the jury I did. The case involved 2 young black men accused of passing bad checks at a bank. The one that actually committed the crime wasn't on trial, but rather turned up to testify for the state and the prosecutor made a point of stating over and over that this young black man came from a good family. His dad, a high ranking police officer and hs mother an administrator with social services. What's that word, 'privilege'. Again, the young black man on the witness stand is the one who committed the crime, and not the one facing the judge. The producers never sat on this jury or listened to 3 days of testimony as the prosecutor laid out the timeline. So what kind of defense did the young black man's attorney put on, who btw was also black. None, nada, nothing. No testimony, no rebuttal, no alternate theories. Just, \"your honor, I rest\". Then in summation when his attorney asked to borrow the multimedia materials the prosecutor put together, I was pretty much dumbfounded and sorry for the defendant but 30 mins to deliberate by a mostly white/brown/not black jury and another young man goes to jail; yeah I felt sorry for him but I also felt he was guilty. Not ironically, I was invited to exactly the same scenario many years later but fortunately I was able to be excused before I had send another black youth to prison. So while the producers might see everything in racial terms, from my personal experience, it's something else entirely. Otherwise how do you explain felony assault on live tv in front of millions of people and not a whiff of prosecution afterwards. And what's up with the guy who killed dahmer in prison. Maybe they should do season 2 all about him; bet it would be a lot more interesting.Also, molly ringwald, michael learned, love their work but man do I feel old now."},{"id":"rw8660876","title":"Unfortunately unnecessarily drawn out","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"7 November 2022","text":"The first few episodes were good and I really wanted to know what would happen next. In my opinion, the series was then unnecessarily drawn out. It would have made more sense to make it a mini-series.However, special praise goes to Evan Peters, for me the successor to Leonardo DiCaprio. Fantastic acting! I hope for his sake that he will no longer be seen only in streaming series, but will also make it into feature films. He has what it takes!It's fun to see Evan Peters in the role of the serial killer, and the creators have more than nailed his look as well.The racist view of the police, who don't take the black neighbor seriously, as well as the relatives of the victims, because they were mainly black, Asian or Hispanic, is well portrayed."},{"id":"rw8637049","title":"A very, very long burn with outstanding acting","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"26 October 2022","text":"Let's get this out of the way first; Evan Peters is nothing short of phenomenonal in the title role. His immersion in the character is evident and the layers to his performance are superb. If you also need any reminder (not that anyone should need it) that Richard Jenkins is one of the most versatile actors on screen today, your proof is here.My issue, however, is in the tempo and creative licence taken by the writers. Very similar to what happened in The Watcher, the very long, very drawn-out story simply doesn't follow a lot of the well-publicised timelines and movements of Dahmer, and instead paints him more as an unwilling participant in compulsive acts rather than the predatorial individual he was.Murphy's writing style obviously strikes a cord with many, but it's not without its frustrations."},{"id":"rw8631500","title":"Well-acted and thoughtful but Nash was a bad choice","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"23 October 2022","text":"With a degree in psychology, I've studied cases like Dahmer's and seen many of the docs offered. My first reaction is this series wants to focus on all the minutia from the first nflx doc where they interviewed the paralegal who recorded all those audio tapes. It follows it pretty closely and actually is not as gruesome, focusing more on the interaction with the victims. I hope they paid Peters a very high salary for not only accepting this role but for his amazing performance.I feel the film focuses too much on some details that we can ascertain in 45 seconds instead of 3 min. But that's part of the new normal in psychological drama.My biggest complaint is the extreme focus on Glenda and the unfortunate use of Nash, who comes off as a comedian no matter what the character she plays.I noticed a lot of reviews claim it turns into libiberal fest (can't use tribigerber words here anymore). But having lived in that time -- in fact being born the same year as Dhamer -- I can say this depicts true situations. I've seen a lot of feedback on films claiming they insert things when really it's just depicting the times. Especially since this is a true story, it is depicting actual events that were, unfortunately, much more common than just this situation.A psych student states that Dahmer was ill, not evil and I have to strongly disagree that there's any difference. It's common for those studying human psychology to mix up the fact that one deserves compassion with the idea that they were not intentionally evil. Law enforcement and the courts do make the differentiation of whether one understood their actions were illegal, and that definition is not a psychological definition, that's true. We can recognize that Hitler, Stalin, and Bin Laden were just humans struggling with some physical or environmental deficiencies or imposed beliefs but the acts they committed were still evil; whether in the psychological or biblical sense could be up for debate.And speaking of environmental, Dahmer's environment is not what caused this. Many kids grow up shooting and skinning animals and they don't kill people. But many children do have enormous emotional and psychological trauma from neglect by a parent. Severe abuse includes neglect/lack of bonding or touching and causes a child to withdraw and numb while still craving human interaction. These are the ingredients for a psychopath. Less than 2% of psychopaths become serial killers. Some believe diet can actually help but that's probably 20 years out when society understands the effects of food on self-control and mood/behavior.Overall a good watch but did fall off the rails the last few episodes like there was a different writer; way too much focus on Glenda with borderline comical acting from Nash. This may be why some viewers feel there was a bent toward focusing on the lack of response from the LE. But in fairness, Glenda did continuously try to get someone over to investigate.Peters and all the victims were amazing. I can't imagine trying to play these parts."},{"id":"rw8560714","title":"Wow Evan...wow!!","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"22 September 2022","text":"This is so well done and Evan Peters is stellar as Dahmer!

We do see quite a good deal of the rather more grim elements of the story, the behaviour, but it's been so sensitively crafted that it's impossible not to feel some amount of sadness for Dahmer on elements of his journey in between killings. The loneliness is so expertly depicted. There's one episode that gives us more of a victim POV, I won't say which, that was so beautifully done that, while also exhibiting some additional degree of horror in relation to what happened in the end, that was so beautifully constructed that rather more than horror, I felt an unexpected and considerable sense of grief, even though I knew what was coming.Anyway, it's almost perfect. Doesn't quite land perfectly at the end, goes on a little long, could have been stripped down to maybe 8 episodes, the ending appearing to drag on a little.

It is intense, gripping, horr-filled, sad, disturbing, and thrilling at times. I would struggle to mention having ever watched a better series than this, truly. It is much more than just being about a serial killer. Nay, it runs much deeper than that. It has so many aspects to it that one would find it hard to capture it in simple writing.Initially, your first impression is that it´s about a serial killer. Then you realise that it´s about a broken family. Then you form the opinion that the blame lies with Jeffrey´s mother, but a while later you discover that his father was an absolute waste of an existence and actually a harmful creature to the society in general and a prime example of what-not-to-be as a father. Then, though, you think that it mildly touches upon the racism prevalent in America, but then you discover towards the end that the whole case is about racism and the preferential treatment of the whites by the authorities over there. You also discover about horrible cases of police negligence. Like, how many of you would believe me if I told you - and the series is based on absolute real events - that the \"white\" American police kept ignoring phone calls from a black woman who kept drawing their attention to the fact that something wrong is happening in Jeff´s apartment all the time throughout the years? How many of you would believe me if I told you that Jeff had \"pieces\" of a dead body in his car and was driving whilst being fully drunk but, him being a white, the poilice let him go with a mild, gracious, warning? Or, or, or - one of the most bizarre things and as one of the greatest examples of negligence - the police returned to this harmless looking white gentleman one of his victims so that he could kill him in peace in his apartment later on? The victim being a 14-year old boy who had managed to run and escape all the way down to the entrance of the building, only to be sent back by two white cops who were just suspended temporarily and returned to work soon. How sick!On the way, you also feel quite clear gracious treatment on the part of a judge of a white guy who was charged for sexually assaulting a minor, and the judge shows very little respect towards the victim or his family. Towards the end you discover that, in America, there´re comic books about such serial killers. Then the final nail in the coffin arrives when, in prison, Jeff receives money and letters of admiration from his fans. All in all, this series holds out a mirror to the great America: its society, its culture, its system, and the way it is run by the authorities. I just cannot praise this Netflix series enough; just can´t. Still, though, here´s a word of respect for Jeff´s paternal grandmother who seemed to be being the only white who was worried about Jeff´s doings and throughout suspected that something was fishy with her grandson.Initially, I had this problem with this series: I questioned the need for making a film or a series on such a creature. My opinion is that such people or their doings should not be made common or be a part of common knowledge or become a topic of discussion in households, and this series does invite that. The thing is that people like Jeff do exist, but only very few of them end up implementing or practising the evil within them and manage to hold their such thoughts to themselves. Such individuals, though, I fear, could be seeing this series as kind of an inspiration or see ideas and suggestions in some of Jeff´s methods as shown in the series. However, given all the factors that I´ve mentioned above, I changed my opinion by the seventh or eighth episode and I, in fact, agree that this was a story, a tragedy of a particular society, which needed to be told. It absolutely had to be told. It was necessary. However, however, I might´ve ideally refrained from making some of Jeff´s acts as graphic and clear. I would´ve rather taken the approach of not showing a lot of the stuff on the screen.Sometimes, a film or a series can be so good that even giving it 10 out of 10 doesn´t suffice, and that´s how I feel here. It deserves way more than just 10 stars. Oh´, and, did I even mention how amazing its fear-inducing background music was? It was terrifying, plain terrifying, folks. Awesome to say the least!"},{"id":"rw8684786","title":"Not for the faint of heart","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"20 November 2022","text":"Dahmer is a well made series. It is shockingly accurate and does not spare its audience from the disturbing murders that happened. Evan Peters steals the show in this series and is the embodiment of Jeffrey Dahmer from his voice, mannerisms and acting. His portrayal is so accurate it is creepy and dark watching Jeffrey in action. From the first episode we are given a dark window into the life of this serial killer and it is beyond disturbed. The timeline and pacing is interesting, they start off with him getting caught and work backwards from that event. This works nicely. You feel sympathy and sadness for his victims but not Jeffrey, he is pure evil.My only criticisms would be I felt Netflix could have shortened this by an episode or two. The heart of the show was his awful deeds which then could have been wrapped up in 2 further episodes. So 8 episodes overall instead of dragging it out to 10. We didn't need to see an episode devoted to Glenda, they already gave her plenty of screen time. Overall not a bad series and I can see why it got so much attention.

There are some awkward 2022 racial politics inserted, as we should expect unfortunately.His childhood and early adulthood are well documented and other films have been made about his school days such as My Friend Dahmer, and this show references that period in his life to good effect.I'm over half way through so I wanted to add a review to encourage others to give it a go, it's grim, especially early on, but it's very well made and worth your time.Edit: now finished the show and the 2nd half is actually much better and gives the victims much more air time.

A few hour long youtube documentaries can pretty much cover everything. Their idea to bounce off different timelines from childhood, adulthood, victims etc and vice versa reminded me of Marvel's Eternals ... the trend of applying too many flashbacks and fast forwards is a terrible story telling method.His childhood and family history is interesting though together with the rest of the grieving victims, should be good for about 5-6 episodes... the rest of the series are just unnecessary fluff ... they keep on going back to the victims and eyewitnesses even after we already established their part in the story. And by adding more stuff it feels kinda low-key glorifying the serial killer.Not sure about the accuracy of this series, I'm sure the directors/writers applied many forms of artistic license to add more drama."},{"id":"rw8599932","title":"Beginning was great.

Knowing a little bit more about the victims gave me some acceptance this series even exists. I can't ever imagine how the families of the lives lost must feel about this.

Not so much now.In the first five episodes I was craving more of a backstory to a victim to balance it a little and build empathy. Episode 6 felt like it had heard me (although Tony probably wouldn't have). I do feel that the show tipped it's creepier, more compelling elements into the first half for the sake of that Netflix style addictive engagement, the latter episodes steer a bit too much into \"well, then this stuff happened I guess\" territory.

However in this case I think Netflix or The Producers of Dahmer did have a moral obligation to let the relatives of the victims of the monstrous Jeffrey Dahmer know that this ten part series was in production ,especially if they were being mentioned by name in the series.Rita Isbell, sister of victim Errol Lindsey, wrote an essay for Insider where she states I feel like Netflix should've asked if we mind or how we felt about making it.Disturbing subject matter like cannibalism, body dissection ,necrophilia and ritual killing of course is distressing and has been depicted before in many movies like Silence of the Lambs, Seven, The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo to name a few but the difference with Dahmer is that it depicts horrible murders some of which occurred just over 30 years ago . Many of the people involved are still living and if they saw this series ,which I doubt they it would could definitely be traumatised .Apparently the Jeffrey Dahmer killings and his story are well known to my American friends but until I saw this series I had never heard of Jeffrey Dahmer or as he was named the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster.This series like most made today is in my opinion is far to long and drawn out at ten episodes.It's a Netflix horror drama series and a very grim tale about one of America's most notorious serial killers. It's largely told from the point of view of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims and his family background.The series also effectively exposes the police incompetence and apathy that allowed Dahmer to go on his multiyear killing spree. The series dramatises at least ten instances where Jeffrey Dahmer was almost apprehended but then ultimately let go including an astounding scene where a deluded Judge virtually pats him on the head and sends him back out into the community.The success of Ryan Murphy's interpretation of this horrible tale of murder and mayhem for me lie in the casting of the actors that portray the characters involved . The star is Evan Peters who is no stranger to Ryan Murphy's horror genre appearing regularly in American Horror Story in various roles and in Pose as Stan Bowes is spellbindingly compulsive as Jeffrey Dahmer . He segues between evil madness to almost please note I said almost rational behaviour.A few rare times in this over nine hour marathon I almost had some empathy or understanding for him due to his traumatic childhood. He has to be unhinged in some way with an absent ineffectual homophobic father who encouraged his son to butcher and dissect roadkill as a bonding exercise plus a traumatised hostile mother who was much more than on the verge of a nervous breakdown at the end of her marriage . This upbringing would not equip or encourage any young child gay or straight to have any sort of functional existence the result of this neglect would surely have contributed to his insane behaviour .The actors cast as the parents are wonderful Richard Jenkins as Lionel Dahmer and Molly Ringwald as Jeffrey Dahmer's mother Shari both give superb performances .Other standouts for me were Michael Learned from The Waltons fame in this role she plays Jeffrey Dahmer's grandmother living under the same roof with a serial killer for a grandson , who lies and justifies his actions when she dares to suspect something is drastically wrong.Her fragility and mental capacity especially when his moods turn to rage deteriorates causing her grandson to leave home where he is free to continue his carnage and is free to hunt out his victims.The other standout for me among a wonderful ensemble cast is Niecy Nash who plays Glenda Cleveland Dahmer's next-door neighbour who lives in the apartment building when he moves in she becomes suspicious.This is when the worst of Dahmer's murderous and cruel rampage of stalking men in Bars drugging them and luring them back to his apartment takes place. Glenda Cleveland knows something hideous is going on by the stench and the screams that she hears through the air vents but her reports to the Police are ignored and she is just treated as another black woman being hysterical.As usual Ryan Murphy the series writer and creator and his team have been accused of taking so much \"artistic license\" that the show does not bear a great deal of resemblance to the facts of the case.I'm not sure if that's so I suspect that's true but I doubt if any television or movie adaptation of actual crime events has ever not used artistic licence ?It's a dramatic adaptation of events not a true life documentary so in fairness to Ryan Murphy who also went over the top with Inside Look: The Assassination of Gianni Versace - American Crime Story . Ryan Murphy is a storyteller and never lets the truth get in the way of a good story that was most evident in his series Hollywood 2020 .This series apparently has been one of the most watched series of the year while the disturbing subject matter certainly wouldn't appeal to everyone it's very well done .This series reminded me of a similar controversy concerning a movie depicting events surrounding factual violent killings being made.That negative publicity caused audiences to stay away in droves .It was the excellent 2021 movie Nitram which was about the events leading up to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania . That movie was also an attempt to understand why and how the atrocity occurred . It also had a fine cast that starred Caleb Landry Jones, Judy Davis and Anthony LaPaglia .These movies I think do serve a purpose and took me back to the 1960's in Sydney when young men were being murdered by William MacDonald The Mutilator, who was Sydney's Most Disturbed Serial Killer.It truly was a dangerous time and if this series about Jeffrey Dahmer alerts one young man to be suspicious of anyone they don't know taking them home or offering them a drink that they can't see being made it is worth the effort of watching and it certainly deserves to be seen ."},{"id":"rw8566749","title":"Some of you just don't get it...","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"25 September 2022","text":"First, this was an incredible docudrama.

The 10 episode series focuses on everything about Dahmer - his childhood, his victims, his neighbors, his family, his murders and ultimately how everyone was impacted around him while he was doing what he was doing and after. The one aspect not covered, likely because of potential blow back from the government, was his behavior while in the military and what led to his discharge...which is also an awful tale.This series was created by Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy who also created Glee. The series stars Evan Peters (X-Men: Apocalypse), Richard Jenkins (Step Brothers), Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Niecy Nash (Reno 911) and Michael Learned (The Waltons).Everything about this series is perfect, especially the way it makes you feel gross with every scene. It's honestly hard to watch and get through. The acting by the entire cast is stupendous, but Evan Peters delivers an Oscar caliber performance. The details in the story telling is outstanding and you also get a good feel for his mindset and approach to everything he did. You get the feeling his family tried not to know what was happening also. It's a frustrating series to watch because it was obvious there were numerous times he could have been stopped. The ultimate resolution for both Dahmer and his victims are well concluded even if not fulfilling.Overall, this may be the greatest docuseries of all time. I'm excited to see what they do with the contract extension for three more series they got from Netflix. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."},{"id":"rw8587380","title":"More than meets the eye...","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"4 October 2022","text":"No one will dispute what Dahmer did was morally reprehensible. In dramatising his life, they took pains to illustrate the structural and overt racism that provided the opportunities for Dahmer to escape capture for 13 years and commit many more murders. Ironically, both Netflix and Murphy seem blinded to their own hypocrisy in going through with making this show without due regard for the families of the mostly non-white victims.The hype surrounding this series is just reaching fever pitch in Australia as the first wave of viewers are now telling others about it. As much as I love true crime, I resisted watching at first because the series is done in poor taste, but curiosity eventually triumphed. The series brings to light certain things I never knew or thought I needed to know about Dahmer. Strangely, the more I learnt about him through the series, the less he seemed the \"monster\" that is in the show's title.He was clinically diagnosed with borderline and schizotypal personality disorders and psychosis. He has also been called a psychopath and a sociopath. Psychopaths and sociopaths rarely ever show remorse like Dahmer did. Nor would they admit there was anything wrong with them; Dahmer had always known there was something intrinsically different about him. Even though it has not been suggested, I think it is likely that he might have been neurodivergent.The neurodivergent community would be rightly horrified to be associated with Dahmer. If they were honest with themselves however, they could probably identify with Dahmer's struggles: social awkwardness, the inability to connect with people, the loneliness of being different, the escape into fantasy (and sometimes addiction) to avoid unbearable emotional pain. Unlike most, Dahmer's fantasy unfortunately required people to be dead in order for him to achieve the peculiar kind of control and intimacy that only he craved."},{"id":"rw8597319","title":"Excellent show","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"8 October 2022","text":"Evan Peters is excellent in the lead role and really captures Dahmer. Overall, the show is excellent. They do a good job of really allowing focus on the victims while telling the story. Really difficult subject matter to get right and they did a good job.There are a couple of episodes that are unnecessary, creating a composite character to tell a story that really isn't needed but seems a prerequisite for all movies and tv shows these days.In my opinion, episode 7 is totally unnecessary, it would have made more sense to just tell the story of the real people rather than merge them, other than that the show is 10/10."},{"id":"rw8600788","title":"Brilliant filmmaking","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"10 October 2022","text":"The first twenty-five minutes of this masterpiece comprise the most terrifying scenes I've seen in serial killer movie making, real or fictional.

Or haven't been at work for the last two days.Since I have to make it to 600 characters, I'll add that I did think some episodes were more gripping than others, and some scenes felt a little repetitive (especially with/about Dahmer's neighbour Glenda Cleveland).

That Tony episode is so depressing and, in my personal opinion, the best episode of the series.The timeline shifts a lot, so things can be a little bit confusing unless you already know a lot about the Dahmer case, which I don't.

My gripe is the amount of time wasted on Glenda and the black community and the victims, which deviated from the main theme of what caused him to become such a dangerous psychopath. The time wasted on Glenda (specifically) could have been spent on how he stalked his victims and how he buried them and the opinion of doctors on how he was what he was.

How senseless can one truly be? I could even understand it if they gave some of the money to the victims' children. ... The victims have children and grandchildren. If the show benefited them in some way, it wouldn't feel so harsh and careless. It's sad that they're just making money off of this tragedy. That's just greed.The families wasn't consulted, neither are they at the very least benefiting from the revenue, but the most shocking of all is the fact that they had ZERO knowledge of its production until it aired. The families of the victims have spoken out, and they're devastated and angry, and rightly so! I strongly urge people to consider what I've said, and if you have the slightest degree of empathy and compassion, I urge you to stand with the families to boycott such a vile production team, until, at the very least, the families benefit from the profits generated from this show."},{"id":"rw8617101","title":"That was uncomfortable to watch.","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"17 October 2022","text":"This series was an emotional rollercoaster to watch.

My heart goes out to the innocent victims families, it is really disappointing that people have made this series a joke. There should be no jokes made about what Jeffrey did to these young men. It is dehumanizing and disgusting to do so. I am confused as to why they put Glenda Cleveland's apartment right next to Jeffrey's, when that was not where she lived. I don't know why Netflix decided to include false details about the story. Seeing the police bring Konerak stuck with me watching the rest of the series. How clueless can 2 police officers be? He was an innocent child. What's not included in the series like most, Tracy Edwards who escaped Dahmer's apartment and got him arrested, has been in prison multiple times for many reasons including murder. It is interesting how he almost got murdered by Jeff, and then testified against him but later on murdered someone else. Overall, I believe this series was good. Evan and Niecy's performances were outstanding. I don't know why people are fixated on continuing the entertainment of Dahmer's terrible actions, but it was okay.

The other characters were all real. I didn't see anyone \"acting.\" The show is creepy, disturbing, and frightening, even if you know the story, and I do.Suffice to say that I was 20 years old in 1978, a part of the gay community in Chicago, and remember this entire case quite well. Jeffrey Dahmer was EXACTLY as you see him on screen in this series -- Peters nailed it to a fault. Those here saying that he appeared to be an automaton, or stupidly, he had no character arc, WAS Dahmer. He had very little human affect to him. He was robotic, and although I won't try to place blame, in hindsight, his mother's drug use during pregnancy may have been a contributing factor, and his father didn't really come around to being demonstrative with Jeffrey until after his crimes were found out, but again, no actual blame to either of them for what Jeffrey Dahmer did. He did what he did all on his own.The writers were not kind to anyone except the people that tried to expose and stop Dahmer before he was finally caught. The Milwaukee police of 1991 were taken down handily, and although that Officers of the Year ceremony didn't happen, it merely drives home the fact that the police homophobia and AIDSaphobia, and blatant racism contributed A LOT to Dahmer being able to have the killing spree he did.I highly recommend this series, but make sure you have 10 hours free because it's doubtful you'll be able to break away from it once you start. Although I didn't find any \"wokeness\" in this series, if you happen to be one of those red-pillers, you might, because you'll be looking for it. Don't do that. It's not really there. Calling something \"woke\" is code for \"this makes me feel uncomfortable because I know it's all true, and that makes me feel icky, but I'm not allowed to show it.\" Everything is not a comic book.

However its impossible to tell if this is great acting or just from a lack of experience, but thinking more of the later.And once again, why is everyone so jacked?How did Dahmer manage to mastermind murders while being in the gym 40 hours every week.And yes the show does like to portray Dahmer as some kind of genius mastermind, with his carefully crafted grand plans where everything just falls into place. Whereas in reality, he just took advantage of societys most vulnerable, kind of like 'beating up a person in a wheelchair'.But Dahmer is the absolute definition of 'just another netflix series'. Low budget, short production time, shallow acting, but 'chasing that vibe'.Even though its not trying to be, this entire series just comes off as pretentious, as it spends way too much time trying to 'get the vibe right', instead of just telling the story.Trending and popular....for reasons still unexplained."},{"id":"rw8572912","title":"Bland but Decent","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"28 September 2022","text":"This series came up short. While it does highlight the failures of the police and Dahmer's family throughout his crime spree, they seem more like background noise in a story with no solid direction and little momentum. It also fails to honor the majority of the victims.There is an obvious desire to create empathy for Dahmer, but it's done without providing any sort of parallel to what would be considered normal human behavior. So we're literally thrust into the world of his broken home without any point of reference to what life SHOULD have been like by use of other \"normal\" characters. The only episode that successfully did this was episode 5 (Tony Hughes) and then we were tossed back into the chaos. The story of Tony is the perfect example of what the entire show had the potential of being where you care for the victim as you truly see the disconnect in Dahmer. You feel bad for Jeffrey's internal struggle but hate who he is when you realize he can't control his impulses. All while you relate to Tony's family and realize what they lost.I think the presence of Ms Cleveland was supposed to be that consistent parallel of baseline human behavior, but again (and by no means the result of Niecy Nash's excellent performance), it comes up feeling hollow, and more like the purpose of her supporting character role was an effort to provide the actual Glenda Cleveland with the credit she deserves for her role in the actual case.The overall feeling is that we're floating through some haphazard timeline between 1978 and 1991 where no real explanation is given for any behavior and you don't really get to know any of the victims (with the exception of Tony). It feels very surface level (even with the stellar acting from the entire cast) and confusing at what emotions the writers are trying to evoke.It's interesting to watch, but it feels like some alternate universe, much like American Horror Story, rather than an honest portrayal of a serial killer and his victims. Are we supposed to feel bad for Jeffrey Dahmer? Are we supposed to be disgusted by him? Overall, the series does what every other series does and fails to truly honor the memory of the victims over the public's fascination with the villain."},{"id":"rw8560532","title":"Creepy as hell","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"22 September 2022","text":"I've been waiting for something since Mind-Hunter got cancelled that would fill it's sinister void, and this new limited series by story-telling legend Ryan Murphy is IT!!Absolutely loved Crime Story & AHS so I knew this would be to the same high standard of acting and production - I wasn't wrong.Evan Peters is chilling at Jeff Dahmer.

Well scripted, directed, and acted; it is a superior crime drama, all told.Evan Peters in the title role is crazy good. He completely captures the strangeness and unease of Dahmer.However. Peters is not believable in looks as someone who had the power to lure men to his place. His face is hard and rather homely. You see in the early 80s mug shots the real Dahmer who had borderline blond porn-star looks, a kind of facial prettiness that could plausibly be a \"bait\" snare.It is a crucial point - believability.Still, the series is enormously compelling, and the back story really provides much."},{"id":"rw8565860","title":"Another woke Netflix show","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"24 September 2022","text":"So the show throughout the first six episodes was brilliant, and dare I say captivating, the acting was fantastic, characters were developed in a great way and you can most definitely tell Dhamer was deeply studied in order to deliver this epic performance.

I'm fairly certain the term wasn't used in the early 90's and only been invented recently. This tipped me off that new era wokeness was being inserted. Which then caused me to revisit something else in an earlier episode. I did remember reading about the women who had found the Laotian boy on the street and him being returned to Dahmer. I wasn't aware that one of them was Dahmer's already grossly suspicious neighbor. That was an entirely different person and not a neighbor. Dahmers neighbor actually wasn't all that suspicious - to the point she in fact ate several sandwiches he gave her. Pretty sure she never called the cops on him either.

She almost gets to the point of coming across a little sanctimonious, however horrendous her experiences clearly were.The court case (I know it was a guilty plea) was also covered in the space of 5 minutes, when I can imagine the emotion and drama of his crimes would have reached their peak.Overall a majestic portrayal, and one I will likely enjoy a third time in the future."},{"id":"rw8703777","title":"Evan Peters absolutely nailed the Jeff Dahmer character!","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"30 November 2022","text":"Evan Peters is terrific in the role of Jeff Dahmer.

It is a grisly, detailed account of the life and killings of Jeffrey Dahmer. Dahmer is one of the most notorious serial killers of the 20th Century. His capture, his killings, his trial, and death are pretty public so this account does a great job at reacting this aspects, but takes the viewer deeper and further. The downside is, perhaps, it is much longer than it needs to be. 10 episodes could have been reduced to 6, easily, and it would have been better. There is no question Evan Peters' performance is nothing short of brilliant. He embodies the almost catatonic and conscienceless of the man himself in his performance. Niecy Nash and Richard Jenkins are very compelling in this. With Ryan Murphy at the helm you know this is filled with graphic sexual perversion and violence, but it does feed the story. The Direction, supporting cast's acting, and cinematography are very good. The story pays great attention to details, especially of the time period. As always music is vital to Murphy's story."},{"id":"rw8671719","title":"Well made, but goes off the rails","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"13 November 2022","text":"The first 5 episodes are well-acted, interesting and engaging. Often difficult to watch, of course, due to the extreme sickness of the crimes, but still very well done.Starting around episode 5 or 6, it completely turns into yet another woke-O-rama, The big difference between this and all the others with the same agenda is the ridiculous, over-the-top, almost cartoonish caricaturing of an entire race/culture. Every member of this particular race/culture (save for one priest) is depicted as horrible, evil, selfish, arrogant, racist, corrupt, and just plain bad (yes, ALL of them). EVERY member of all other races/cultures are depicted as decent, moral, ethical, kind, caring, sensible, and just plain good (yes, ALL of them). The ONLY exception in the entire series was a priest, and possibly Lionel Dahmer and Chief Arreola (although he was depicted doing the right thing ONLY because of public pressure). I have no problem with showing the truth, warts and all, as that is very necessary to tell the whole story. It's just that it turned into a clumsy, almost laughably obvious attempt at depicting ALL people of one race/culture as evil. Even all the minor characters from this particular race/culture are slimeballs - according to Netflix.There's almost no other way to describe the last five or six episodes as anything other than racist propaganda."},{"id":"rw8783305","title":"Very good","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"7 January 2023","text":"This show was beautiful cinematography.

The atmosphere of dread and filth, the haunting theme song, and the continued unpredictability carries the story from start to finish. The crimes themselves aren't even the \"star\" of the show as much as the acting, writing, and constant tension wondering what will happen next. Have I mentioned the acting is top notch?Having never heard the Jeffrey Dahmer story, everything was new to me.

The stories and scenes were accurate to the real life time line and showed how sick he is. Secondly, it did a really good job diving into the reasons and factors throughout his life that drove all of this to unfold. It was really engaging and interesting.

If you don't, there are spoilers in my review.A must watch, great acting, in a true story about an evil human being that walked the earth scot-free for a awful long time before he got caught.The Dahmer story in ten gutwrenching episodes. The failure of the police to follow up on calls that were made by his neighbour Glenda Cleveland. The neighbour that was dismissed a thousand times and had they listened, there could have, would have, should have been less victims.There is some great acting by Evan Peters because at no point you feel bad for Dahmer, or even relate a little bit. Richard Jenkins as his dad, Lionel Dahmer, gives a great performance aswell, and Niecy Nash as the ignored neighbour Glenda Cleveland aces her part.You can almost smell the decay, sweat, stench, mold and the bloodsoaked matrass but the worst smell of the entire series is the story about how this Dahmer got away with his crimes for so long, and how little there was done for the (families of) boys and men who went missing, and how little there was done by authorities for the victims, letting each person who watches this, to have an opinion on who is to blame, if any. But the real 911 call by Glenda at the end of one of the episodes, is witness to the devil may care attitude by the authorities involved, because (so it seems) it was all happening in the black, poor and gay community. So no one, except for her, really cared.All in all an amazing story telling by. Ryan Murphy (why, at first, I thought they would steer from the true story but the absolutely did not) about a serial killer that didn't have to make so many victims, had they listened to Glenda. Cleveland in the first place.There are no spoilers for people who know the story. And one can go into detail about the disorders Dahmer may have suffered from, but sometimes some people are just plain evil.This story does not claim anything about what might have been, or gone wrong with him, it just tells the story of an evil man that for a long time, got away with murder."},{"id":"rw8606894","title":"This series never should have been done","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"13 October 2022","text":"All of the actors in this series did a great job, specifically Peters who portrayed Dahmer. But that's the only reason to why I give this a 3/10 instead of a 1/10.I've watched lots of true crime, but this series was something else. Netflix has taken a real life event - peoples real trauma (let me remind you that this did not happen thaaat long ago either) - and made it into a tv-show mixed with fictional events. What makes this different from lots of other true crime that I've seen is that they have real actors (who dresses the same as the real victims and of course are named the same thing as them) who they've used to recreate the scenes of the murderers. If you don't find any issues with this ethically yet, please have in mind that lots of the murderers that are shown in this series have made up stuff thrown in to the scenes which never has never happened just to make it more interesting for the viewer. For example the episode that focused on the very sweet deaf guy that unfortunately met paths with Dahmer, that was not at all how his last day looked like. What make this even more ethically wrong, is that Netflix did not even ask or inform the families of the victims first.It's awful how hard Netflix are trying to capitalize on so many completely innocent young mens deaths. This series never should have been made. I feel genuinely sorry for the victims families about having to relive this again, I never would have watched it through if I knew everything I've learned from googling the case now after I've seen it."},{"id":"rw8586888","title":"Too many episodes ruined a great narrative","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"4 October 2022","text":"The Jeffery Dahmer story was a very disturbing story to hear as it happened and I was hesitant to watch this series because I was resistant to relive this reality. Unfortunately for the viewers, the writers decided that dragging the story out was better than giving a concise narrative of actual events.From my recollection, every storyline was accurately told in this series. However, I my opinion, repeatedly telling the side of the victim and their families takes away from the fact that Jeffery Dahmer was a demonic person. The victim storyline, while extremely accurate, gave the writers to attempt to show Dahmer as a sympathetic individual...which he was not.The writers/producers at Netflix need to realize that fewer episodes with a good story is better than extra episodes with a dragged out storyline.

You wanna make a fictional suspenseful show about a psychopathic killer? By all means do. I've seen Halloween, I've seen them all, but leave the real ones to rot and to be forgotten about.

There's already been so many works done on the Dahmer story. Capping this at four one-hour long episodes could have been accomplished.The series is full of peaks and valleys, mostly the latter. I can't say it's a binge worthy series- usually I'm not eager to flip to the next episode right away (like I was with Netflix's \"You\" or Apple TV's \"Severance\"). I think the camera work is astonishing and Evan Peters and Richard Jenkins do a good portrayal of Jeff and Lionel Dahmer respectively. It's definitely a grotesque and unpleasant series to watch, but it's tolerable in terms of Netflix content. I particularly like the scenes of Jeff speaking with the cops (while Jeff is pulled over and when they visit his apartment) and psychologist. This all helps us enter the deranged character's psyche.The fervent interest in Dahmer's mental state, fetishes, and killings makes sense, but the creators are putting in too many extraneous details. We don't really need to see the Dahmer's before Jeff was born, Joyce Dahmer's work life or addiction, or Jeff's extended interactions with a mannequin or his erotic magazines. Those are just a few examples, but the constant oscillation of the time period can also get confusing. This simply wasn't streamlined and it's hard to tell what the focus is.So I can recommend giving it a chance just for the shock factor.

Peters gave a good performance which to my knowledge of Dahmer portrayed him quite well. From what I've read on Dahmer this story seems to keep to the story. Will we ever know why he committed these atrocious acts? Probably not. It also shows how a parents love for a child can still survive such a crime. There is also a side to this series that touches on the 'Is it really the fault of the perpetrator' if there is a problem with the wiring of the brain and should that be taken into consideration when treating such offenders.

This is just another example of wokeness. I don't understand why Netflix and other Hollywood productions have to push there narrative in our faces with everything they make. It's getting to be ridiculous with all the In accuracies in all of there productions. Also the police officer scene where they received officer awards of the year was false aswell. Anyway that's just my take on this I didn't enjoy it at all and if your looking for some false narrative to push there agenda then this Is for you."},{"id":"rw8584620","title":"Good show.

Very interesting story and the main actor made a fantasticly cringey person that made your skin crawl. I did enjoy seeing a bit of back story on some of the victims and even Dahmer himself. I especially felt awful about the young boy. What a horrible scene.What lost me was the ending. The last few episodes just weren't up to par with the others. It became a social justice rant rather than really showing the fallout of what the victim's families were going through. I feel like if the show would have focused on the victims more, it would have been much better received.Lastly, from my understanding, there were inaccuracies in the show. I remember being told that Jeffrey Dahmer became a different person in prison. I feel like a documentary drama should at least be accurate to the story. Otherwise, it's not a documentary, it's just a drama loosely based off of real events."},{"id":"rw8571941","title":"per usual","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"27 September 2022","text":"Take a monster story (that EVERYBODY already knows) and make all the white people bad and all people of color either righteous or victims...wash rinse repeat Netflix.

I remember reading about Dahmar years ago but this movie made these things come to life.This is Avery disturbing true story of a man who did awful things.

It was watchable, and some of the scenes accurately portrayed, but just not what I was expecting knowing the case quite well.The real story is much more sister, but I guess they could not really portray all of the details.The casting was great and the settings great, but I think it would have done the victims more justice if they had all had a mention so to speak. And maybe use of more of the information from his interviews would have been an added aspect.I'm not sure why deviations from the facts were included, perhaps for storytelling, but overall I was quite disappointed."},{"id":"rw8584532","title":"Brutal in more ways than one!","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"3 October 2022","text":"The people making the show should have spoken to the families of the victims and the survivors because of course they should have. I don't know why they didn't. Perhaps they thought the poor people wouldn't go for it if they were told the show's intent, and why would they? Now the makers of the show have left themselves open to lawsuits, especially considering the show is re-traumatizing all of those people. Which, of course, raises the question, \"Why are they watching it?\" Maybe for closure? I don't know. If that's the case, great. Then again, I don't know what closure they could find in a TV show. Whatever. My sympathies are with them and have been with them for a long time.With all that said, let's get to my review:This show is everything that crappy Zac Efron Ted Bundy movie should've been!Evan Peters gives a career-best performance as Jeffrey Dahmer! I've seen the interviews with the serial killer and I saw the serial killer, not Evan Peters.Richard Jenkins was also really fantastic!This is the first thing I've ever seen Niecy Nash in and now I want to see her in more!All of the performances were really great. (Also, holy crap, Molly Ringwald!)It offers more than just an insight into Jeffrey Dahmer's life and psyche.The goals of this show are to inform, disturb, and upset you and it succeeds in all regards!I like how it doesn't show the murders being committed, instead having you rely on your imagination. Makes it much more effective, not to mention respectful to the families of the victims and the victims themselves.The music is very well-done and appropriately used!It's incredibly well-shot and atmospheric!The use of colors was great!The directing was awesome!It's very well-written!The editing was very purposeful and unsettling. Although, sometimes the editing was a little annoying in the sense that it felt jarring when it jumped from the past to the present, and the present to the future. At times I felt like the pacing was off. And, personal point, I wish they had kept the whole freak out in the court scene. That actress did a great job by the way!Hopefully they'll make more serial killer miniseries. Make one for Ted Bundy and recast Zac Efron. Other than the hacksaw scene his casting was the only good thing about that movie. And if these same people decide to make more shows, hopefully they will speak to the families of the victims and survivors of the respective killer.If you haven't watched this then you should get right on that! But it's not for the faint of heart! This will likely be upsetting for people and it might even keep you up at night because of how blunt and visceral it is. There are images from the show that are permanently seared into my brain and every time I think of them I wince."},{"id":"rw8559420","title":"Disturbingly brilliant","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"21 September 2022","text":"I have been waiting to watch this for some time now and I am not disappointed! Evan Peters portrayal of Jeffery Dahmer is a masterpiece.Right from the beginning I was hooked & throughout, it was very accurate to the real facts behind the horrific story of Dahmer.All the actors starring in this were fantastic, great selection.Usually with serial killer programmes/series they're not good, they feel very fake but this was not.Ryan Murphy needs to do more series on serial killers as he very talented and can portray their lives in a way that keeps the viewer hooked.

It is equal parts disturbing and utterly heartbreaking, even a somewhat sensitive viewer may find themselves very freaked out.The writing, the acting, the production design, the music, all of it is so well crafted its hard to critique. I hated how gory it was and you were never spared the violence, but I get why. We needed to know in order to understand what comes next. I felt this was less a story about a murderer and more a story about the poison of systemic racism in our society. It hits the bulls eye on the consequences of prejudice and in this story, had the powers that be seen the truth rather than skin color, all these poor people and their families would have been spared. Its a damming judgment on the justice system and sadly, not much has changed since then.This is one of the very few murder serials that has accomplished leaving the viewer not with thoughts of the murderer, but of the victims and their families. I now know their names! Their names are repeated over and over. Their stories are told and I think this was the point.The show captures the rupturing impact of the kind of grief violent crime creates. As someone who lost a close family member to murder, I felt it perfectly depicted the impact of a loss of that nature. The psychological trauma, the fear of the monster who did this, the anger, the nightmares, the inconsolable grief all paralleled by the horror of the events that led to it. People need to see this.I rate this show highly, but watch at own risk.

The highlight of the series is the performances of the actors. Every actors has lit up the series with their display. Jeffrey Dahmer is played by Evan Peters and he is outstanding. He gives that serial killer vibe.Series makes you indulge in itself. Jeffrey Dahmer's story revolves around how he turned into a serial killer. The timeline changes between each scene due to the non-chronological presentation of the story. I like this way of representing a story. We see the event first and then it unfolds itself about how it happened.Background score is amazing.

This is literally a cash grab at the expense of retraumatizing the families of the victims. They did not consent to the making of this series. Yes, netflix doesn't legally need consent from them, but from a moral standpoint, they should have. Some of the families are considering lawsuits against this series. This is not speculation.These tragedies are NOT entertainment. And if you view it as entertainment, you have no sympathy for the families.

The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more shocking to watch, and perhaps some viewers may leave traumatized with certain scenes. And all thanks to a great directing job and to the actor Evan Peters, who has achieved an incredible interpretation worthy of creating terror to the viewer.We can observe human cruelty in its maximum splendor, but the series proposes us to see it from different types of perspectives, both of the murderer and the victims. At no time does it try to justify Dahmer's criminal acts, but rather it proposes us to think about whether his psychopathic behavior was due to certain factors such as a difficult life in his childhood or simply having a neurological problem or both.Perhaps many parents will see this and understand that the education of a child is not just giving him food and taking him to school, it is also important to give him attention, and that is what the series shows us. And if Dahmer had had better parents would he have done all that? We will never know."},{"id":"rw8588118","title":"Two words: Chilling & Gruesome","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"4 October 2022","text":"True It's very well done and realistic which makes it all the more disturbing even though some unnecessary liberties were taken.STORY The story is about Jeff Dahmer a conficted serial killer who was genuine brutal in these heinous acts. Mostly it's real, although the well spoken real Jeff as seen in his interviews is barely visible mostly we see an awkward TV version of him with fitting dialogue.ANALYSIS\nIt's a chilling but very interesting watch that dives into the backstory of Jeff. A viewer discretion warning seems appropriate here. But for those that are continuing after the somewhat shocking events of the first episode a true gripping story awaits. The first episode is near perfection. But it ads a lot of made up family dialogue in the following episodes. Towards the last 2-3 episodes, the series tries to reinvent itself and turn into a civil rights discussion. Whilst the topics being inserted are important topics, the way that it is done feels abrupt and bolted on as and afterthought. It also speaks on another infamous person on the end which reminds me of the inclusion of the Nun and the Crooked Man in horror franchises by Warner Bros. A service to the network to plug for another series.Acting: 10/10 all actors are doing really well. Evan Peters as the titular role's performance is award worthy for its screenplay, even though it lacks the easy talking elements that the real Dahmer has show in recordings and interviews..Visuals/Costumes (Decor): 9/10 very 90s the outfits take you back to the era.Musical Score: the background goes really well with the atmosphere. Aside from that make hits from the era are accompanying the scenes and characters whichLiberties taken: there a lot of emphasis on Jeffs obsession with meat, and less on his human side. It is a though balance to make when producing anything on the topic. Humanizing the perpetrator whilst many people fell victim to horrible crimes.Jeffrey is totally awkward throughout, only in the 6th episode we get the see a more balanced view. In real life there are videos of him being well spoken which explains better how guys were falling for him. Also when it comes to the activities that happened in the bathhouses the amount in real life are much higher. Some of the scenes are almost exactly copied from what happened, whilst some facts like the neighbour lady living next door instead of in another building are made up, this also applied to some of the stories of the victims.It seems like the reality would have been enough in these situations.End word: Netflix is here to entertain and make money. And there is a big of an ethical question that will probably always arise when we speak about productions on real life horror stories of murders. But at the end of the day. These stories will find there way to the public and at least in this format the story is told well.As much as it has something disturbing about it. The story will make it's way to the public. And this story seem more complete then people hearing only details. And for that I will recommend it to anyone intrigued by the topic. Just one final warning, it's really not for the fainthearted ones amongst us. Just whenever you think you are just watching the story unfold 'stuff' happens. And if you really want to figure out the true story, watch a documentary on it on YouTube or elsewhere. With these series we can hope the last media about the person has seen light."},{"id":"rw8570284","title":"Evan Peters, wow","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"26 September 2022","text":"I have always liked Evan, but this is a whole other level (I know a cliché). He goes from tenderness to monstrous in a heartbeat. The supporting cast is outstanding too. This is one of those really tough viewing series that keeps you gripped and you can't look away. The only other series that was like this in recent memory, was Chernobyl. That feeling of dread in the pit of your stomach. It's not even the same genre but that gripping horror is the same. The one thing that the Dahmer series dies, is keep the directly gruesome images out, it's mostly indirect but you know exactly what you're (not) looking at."},{"id":"rw8566521","title":"My expectations were too high","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"25 September 2022","text":"I find the first two episodes very slow moving and I almost didn't make it past them. But luckily it gets better as there is more room for the other characters in the story later on.I don't particularly enjoy just replaying the scenes of Dahmer on the hunt despite the brilliant performance from Peters. To me the side characters and their point of view in the story is much more interesting. And second part of the mini series delivers exactly that.Adding more scenes with the engagement with the police on uncovering the crimes would add some other angle.

The tone is completely off. They've written this show like a horror movie which is too good of a treatment for a villain like Jeffrey Dahmer. Jeffrey Dahmer doesn't deserve a TV show. His work doesn't deserve to be glamorized and showcased for a wide audience.I think this would've been better as a documentary subject where we can give victims and families a voice rather than dramatizing them on screen and also where we could extract broader meaning to what his killings meant and what we cab learn.I'm not trying to make a moral argument against true crime material. I've consumed as much as anyone, but certain subjects are only properly treated in a specific medium and I don't think TV miniseries is right for Dahmer.

There is a ton about this show to like. It was very well made. Phenomenal acting. Disturbing atmosphere. I really DID enjoy it quite a bit. I would recommend it.But it goes off the rails exactly halfway through. Up to episode 5, I was hooked. Starting with the 6th it got progressively boring and slow. They threw a whole episode away on the deaf guy and it somehow became the Niecy Nash show.On top of that, they totally rewrote things to give them some kind of political or social justice edge. Exaggerations to flat out fabrications.Don't treat this as a documentary in any way. It's WILDLY inaccurate. They basically took the real people/places and tossed them into a sandbox to arrange them how they wanted but much of it is wrong. When you see the little asterisk with *based on true events* take them at their word... lightly \"based on\" with ridiculous liberties. I have to deduct major points for that, especially with how they tried to spin it.And I wish they would have focused more on the killings but they kind of glossed over it while making it minimally gory. Much is implied but not shown. I'm not a fan of that style when it comes to horror or crime.One thing I want to say that they did amazingly well, and I don't know if it was even on purpose, was the portrayal of Jeffrey's feelings and struggles with a personality disorder. I was diagnosed in my early 20's with the same thing as Dahmer, Borderline Personality Disorder. In this show he expressed constant and chronic feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and despair which led him to self-destructive behaviors and habits. They really got that right. I felt what Dahmer felt. I've lived that experience.Anyway, enjoy it but remember that it's entertainment and not a history lesson."},{"id":"rw8578275","title":"Dahmer if you do, Dahmer if you don't","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"30 September 2022","text":"Evan Peters captures the dull, blunted tone and unnervingly icy - I'm here but not really here - mannerisms of Jeff Dahmer. His acting is on another level and much better than all of the others who have played the man, the monster. While watching Evan Peters in this role, I was reminded of another actor, another character, this one fictitious. None other than Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite. Which makes me wonder, knowing that Evan, off set, has a mordacious sense of humor, if he channeled Napoleon D just for some inside craps and giggles. Kind of the way he channeled Pacino's Serpico in Mare of Eastown. Aside from Peters' profound, if somewhat, at times, derivative performance, Niecy Nash is special as the nosey (in more ways than one) neighbor - glad she passed on that gift sandwich from Jeff, and Rich Jenkins logs his finest outing since Six Feet Under and/or Step Brothers. I'm glad they showed not only the monstrous side of JD but also the human side. It's important to show the latter in these kinds of shows as it may help with prevention of crime in the future; you know, early warning signs and all. Also, the sets, especially Jeff's apartment, look so real and scuzzy that you may be inclined to take a long Silkwood shower after viewing half an episode. In the end, it is the palpable, oozing eeriness that will get you and haunt you long after you view this."},{"id":"rw8631032","title":"Started off well then became a mess","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"23 October 2022","text":"Started off well, well directed and interesting portrayal in the first 5 or 6 episodes then it became this tropey historically inaccurate overly dramatised mess. I don't get why but it's like 'this is how crazy people act' and 'this is how people act when they're upset'. Rigid. Uncreative. Unoriginal. Full of pointless scenes that never actually happened e.g the sandwich scene, never happened in fact Jeff's neighbor is a composite of two people. Why can't they just tell it like it happened, Jeff was a terrible murderer no doubt. I don't need it garnished with unnecessary flourish!

The script based on the already well-known true events of the \"Milwaukee Butcher\" is structured in a non-linear way in most of the episodes, taking us to the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's, to the different stages of life of its protagonist and his horrible crimes, plunging us into the question of what led him to do them, perhaps his relationship of abandonment with which he grew up? The emphasis on the lives of its victims and their families are quite well represented and lead you to be part of their suffering, to understand the anger and pain with which they fight/fought, in addition to the fact that social criticism remains the same more 30 years later: the incompetence of the police and their view that ignores still marginalized societies. The cast is well chosen, Evan Peters has made a name for himself playing maniacs, but this time he went much further and portrayed Jeff Dahmer as realistically as possible, Andrew Shaver gives an excellent dramatic performance as Lionel Dahmer and Niecy Nash as Glenda Cleveland demonstrates her great histrionic capacity, deserving to be more recognized her career as an actress, these three actors should definitely appear in the Emmy or Golden Globes nominations next year. It should be noted that it is good to see Molly Ringwald again in a quality production, offering a good performance, it should also be noted the performances of Michael Learned who is a tremendous actress and the actors Shaun J. Brown and Rodney Burford whose professional careers are promising. All the episodes are of tremendous quality, but it is worth noting the suspense used in the first episode, the cloudiness of the fourth and the highly dramatic sixth. Jennifer Lynch, Paris Barclay and Gregg Araki are three of the directors of the series, each with great careers and who translate their work into their respective episodes that each one directed. The costume design and the setting are the most noticeable, each decade is shown in an impeccable way. The soundtrack is an auditory delight, both the incidental music and the one that accompanies each decade. After all the charms of this series, it should be noted that Jeffrey Dahmer has not been romanticized, a realistic work has been carried out that shows how little society has changed in terms of its judicial system and the prejudices of those who make it up, this tells us it serves to remind us that the most gruesome history is the one that keeps repeating itself."},{"id":"rw8575088","title":"Yes to Evan Peters acting","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"29 September 2022","text":"Peter Evans is a masterful actor. I wanted to watch this series as I love American Horror Story and in my opinion Evan's work in AHS is outstanding. The problem for me with this Jeffrey Dahmer series is that is it based on true events and quite frankly it makes me feel extremely uneasy for myself and the victims and their families on seeing how a psychopath stalked and killed his prey. Do I really need to know these details in my life for entertainment? No I don't and that's why I stopped watching it. Jeffrey was an extremely sick individual and putting his sickness on tv for others to emulate or marvel over is quite revolting.

I personally found Evan Peters' performance good but annoying. I am not familiar with Dahmer's true voice and mannerisms and I would assume Peters studied them. If so, Dahmers himself had some very annoying voice and accent ticks, and perhaps Peters is just doing the best he can. Niecy Nash's performance as Dahmer's persistent neighbour is stellar. She deserves a SAG or an Emmy for her amazing portrayal. Her scene with Jesse Jackson is particularly poignant and impactful.Ryan Murphy's take on the life of Dahmer May not be everybody's cup of tea, but such a topic unfortunately cannot be glossed over."},{"id":"rw8601931","title":"Good acting, but slow and ultimately has nothing new to say","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"11 October 2022","text":"The main problem with this series is that it stretches some very thin material to an almost unbearably slow run time. As so often with TV series, it's 90% filler, and the narrative thrust gets lost.This would have worked much better as a movie.Much of the scenes are unnecessary or drawn out in a way that could be shortened otherwise.Sounds of Dahmer doing his horror stuff run over a black screen at one point. This could have been more efficiently handled by doing an L cut and having them run over scenes of seeming normality. Or scenes of his neighbor. There's a story to tell here about police incompetence and Dahmer using his homosexuality as a shield to prevent people from snooping around, or reinforce their stereotype of gay people being weird enough to not investigate the smell and disappearing people. The entire case is a textbook example of police incompetence.The narrative structure is further damaged by the time jumps, which are completely unnecessary in a documentary style series. Tarantino can get away with nonlinear story telling. This material here cannot.Aside from the runtime and narrative focus, the series' biggest detriment is its raison d'etre. Why was this made? Did we really need another series after several movies and series that exploits this tragedy for cheap thrills? Worst of all is the pretense of trying to \"give a face to the victims.\" Yeah right. That's why the series is titled \"Dahmer\". It's exploitation of a tragedy, pure and simple.Now granted, this can still be entertaining or interesting if done right. And a lot of it is interesting. Aside from the curious aspects of the actual case, the acting here is brilliant by everyone involved, especially the lead. He absolutely nails his portrayal of Dahmer with all the small vulnerabilities and the cunning and depravity.If you have nothing better to do and are interested in the case, it's certainly worth watching for the acting alone.If you're looking for horror thrills, you'll be disappointed, since most of the violence isn't shown.If you enjoy faster paced storytelling or expect new information, you will be sorely disappointed. Maybe as with many series there will be a 2 hour fanedit version eventually that can fix the pacing issues. But even so.. you're not missing out on anything of substance by skipping this. It's a big investment of time into watching something that you'll forget about the very next day."},{"id":"rw8636418","title":"This Show Should not have Aired.","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"26 October 2022","text":"I am utterly disturbed. This is the only review I have ever written, and this is because this show is a grossly real interpretation of real evil. The reminder that someone like Jeffrey Dahmer lived and did this to men and families is not only upsetting but it really has an effect on my heart. I can't finish the show after episode six. It finally went too far to where it was beyond me to even finish the show. This is what evil looks like.

It was such a creepy and dangerously believable role. The transformation was amazing to see 'Dahmer' develop in each episode and get bolder.I had heard of Jeffrey Dahmer but didn't really understand the whole story. From the perspective of the victims and the incompetence of the police and judge(s) it was a very shocking experience and a very hard watch.I would highly recommend watching this series - not to glorify Dahmer who in my view was insane to say the least but to give justice to each and every victim who were robbed of a life and not given the justice they deserve. Most of these men would have been alive today if Dahmer had been stopped earlier, very much earlier. Shame on the justice system for failing each and every one of these men."},{"id":"rw8577675","title":"Difficult to watch for the wrong reason.","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"30 September 2022","text":"My god this show is SLOW moving. Seriously, I kept on putting the show on pause because I will just lose interest in how slow and boring it is. I feel like the hype of the show is base on people being a fan of Peter Evans and not because of the show itself. Yes, perhaps Peter Evans did a good job in acting but I feel the rest of the screen play is just horrible. There is WAY TOO MUCH focus on Evan Peter as an actor than who ge us actually portraying in the show. Which is why I feel it's irrelevant if this show was meant to be about Jeffery Dahmer or something entirely different like Pokemon?! I just can't. I gave up after I finished the third episode. It's just...that bad. I also highly doubt that's how the real Jeffery Dahmer was like as well. This is such hollywoodfied throw up of a serial killer's biography."},{"id":"rw8615470","title":"A False Shepherd for the Victims","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"16 October 2022","text":"This is not the sort of series I generally give a 5. Normally, this would be a 6 or a 7. The cinematography is competent, sometimes good. The production and art design is generally pretty good. The writing is more than adequate, it satisfies and more. The performances are probably the best part, they're actually very compelling; in fact, my curiosity tp see Evan Peters in this role is the only reason I gave Dahmer a shot. But, I digress: shows with above average quality normally get an above average rating from me, except in cases where the show had a damaging effect on the world (for example, the South Park episode that accidentally created gingerism), or which deal with sensitive subject matter insensitively and without a necessary level of tact.Dahmer uses the story of Jeffrey Dahmer for a sensational story with a famous serial killer name brand for extra viewership, but the show never deals with or addresses the effects it might have on the living victims and family of the man himself. I didn't realize this when I started the show, and didn't think too research until halfway through, that Jeffrey Dahmer's parents may still be alive. His father is. I don't know about you, but having seen the series and it's portrayal of Lionel Dahmer, I don't like that one bit. The series never talked to the victims' relatives, either. That's my main issue, but it's a big one. I don't think that you could, in good conscience, make a biopic about a serial killer without talking to the people who live with that trauma every day. It's disrespectful.As well, I think that the changes made to the true story were often morally questionable, such as the depiction of Steven Hicks' murder, which was made significantly less egregious and unjustifiable than the true story. It's not like they made it seem reasonable; but certainly less deranged and much more understandable given the context. I think that the gruesome and horrifying details this show occasionally decides to dance around would make an equally compelling story that the semi truth they choose to tell, and therefore I cannot see any good reason behind it. Even more egregious is the fictional depiction of Jeffrey Dahmer and Tony Hughes as having a reltionship, when in fact Tony was killed just like all the others: the night they met Jeffrey. I found this fabricated friendship between the two to be grossly inappropriate and wholly unnecessary. They could have invented a fake person, instead of distorting the image and life of a real human victim.I have no doubt this story was made with the victims at it's heart, but many questionable choices were made that seem antithetical to that heart. As well, the show was kind of boring toward the end, so yeah. 5/10."},{"id":"rw8582287","title":"AGAINST THE GRAIN","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"2 October 2022","text":"I am probably in the minority about this series, but it is pretty much...\ndull, tedious, predictable and at times, even more dull, tedious and predictable.Evans Peters: like watching paint dry. If that what the real Dahmer was like, then...who would even talk to him?Not to be insulting, but he reminded me a lot more like the TV M*A*S*H* character Radar O'Reilly, i.e. Gary Burghoff.It was a harrowing, tragic time back then while the real Dahmer case was unfolding when the news was saturated with the story. It wasn't all that creepy, nor was it scary. Even if someone knew nothing about Dahmer, they could see how the director set scenes up - basically you knew what was coming.Sorry, folks.

It's a biopic of Dahmer, but the makers didn't try to get into his head or point out causes (which could have made for excuses) for his behavior. They evidently wanted to focus on the devastating effect that his crimes had on the families of his victims and on his own family, especially his father. There certainly are some gruesome scenes, but most of the story is pictured in a very slow and cautious way, making the almost clinical way in which Dahmer acts even more sinister and almost unbearable. This is also and very much the merit of Evan Peters, who does an exceptionable job as Jeffrey. But also Richard Jenkins should be mentioned, as the guilt-ridden and desperate, but unrelentingly loyal father Lionel. And Niece Nash as the exasperated neighbor Glenda, who's cries for help were time and again ignored.In the last episode a judge said something that still lingers in my head: \"we (the victims and their families, the family of Dahmer, the public) have to try and live with the fact that we will never know what went on in the mind of such a serial killer and made him do the things he did\".

Credits to Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy for that. I binge watched it, like many others did before me. Everything is of top quality in this show, but the acting is what really stands out. Evan Peters just killed it playing Dahmer. He already did it once before in an American Horror Story episode, another hit from Ryan Murphy. He's perfect for this role and not only because his physique looked very similar to the real Dahmer. Niecy Nash was also outstanding playing the worried neighbour. Something different for her this time as comedies are normally more her thing. Richard Jenkins as the father was very convincing as well. Good directing from Jennifer Lynch, glad to see she's doing better things than her father David, well that's only my opinion. The story itself is one almost everyone heard about before, read the story or watched a movie or documentary about it. Of course the whole cannibalism touch to it is disgusting but that's not what disgusted me the most about the story, not even Jeff Dahmer himself. What I found profoundly chocking was the police (non)efforts to catch him, or better said the total ignoring of all facts presented to them. I guess a white boy doing his sick stuff in a mostly coloured neighbourhood, that's just a thing they are not interested in. The police could have prevented a lot of innocent people getting butchered, getting killed, and instead of doing something about that problem they even got rewarded as police officers of the year.

It's not supposed to be gore or visceral, but Netflix's approach is a little bit too soft for this kind of story. Not only that, it lacks historical accuracy. By \"saving\" viewers from certain details of Dahmer's crimes, people who didn't know the story beforehand might still be unaware of the full extent of his madness, by the end of this series, and yes, that fact contributes to the feeling of empathy that many of the viewers might develop for him, throughout the story.I'm being purposely vague, so I don't spoil anything, but in the end, I'm very disappointed, the 6 out of 10 is just because I loved E.

It's very wel made in every aspect of cinematographic art. Camerawork, acting, scenario and dialogues are above and beyond average. The story sticks.The quality of this series is not only in depicting Dahmers life and crimes in a truthful way. It places all of the events in the context of that time, which adds to the uncomfortable truth that Dahmer could go on for so long. We see racism within the police force, the beginning and advance of AIDS, a strong religious culture with all of its taboos and 'things not spoken about'. We're also confronted with a sich phenomenon that still exists today: people in full an sick admiration of Dahmer, asking for his autograph and sending him money. Companies that build on the gruesome deeds by publishing comic books on the story. A police force with a culture that makes change hard, if not impossible.The series not only shows the story of a very sick man, but also of a (partially) sick society.

And maybe he does, but nothing can justify the evil actions he chose to make. And the show does a decent job illustrating just how heinous his crimes actually were.It's pretty disturbing, especially for someone not used to seeing things like subjective cannibalism, true crime photos, and horrible reenactments that are highly sexualized on screen.It's interesting to learn the facts about Dahmer, albeit through a more stylized, produced semi-fictional portrayal. What is it about serial killers that we find fascinating? Maybe it's because they are able to do things beyond our own comprehension or capabilities. Maybe because like the song \"Vicarious\" by Tool, we live vicariously through the most evil and violent characters on TV because they can do the most atrocious acts that we can only imagine, without any consequences, because they are merely characters in a show, and they can get away acting out the most vile thoughts of our own collective imaginations, and we can sit and enjoy it without the fear of reaping any of the ramifications.Or maybe there's no deep explanation, and some of us viewers just find it fascinating.

They were real people with loving families, breathing, living, hoping. The main actor's acting was brilliant.. a disturbing person with a lot of external things from the way that he walks, he doesn't move his arms when he walks and talks and his appearance very close to the real one Dahmer...

His mother Shari was played by Molly Ringwald used to take painkillers and other drugs during her pregnancy with Dahmer. The public viewed him as a monster but from his point of view he was just as normal as anyone else. I blame the parents for his upbringing, maybe if he had a proper parental units he would not have the urgency to the awful things.

Taken in as a full 10 hours this became, for me, less than just about Jeffrey & more of an epic composition of stories of different people all of whom became caught up in the ensuing cat-5 this story would become. It becomes a commentary of humans & humanity. Of guilt vs shame vs apathy vs blame. Of religion and how humans view religion, regardless of affiliation, and use it in their own individual way to gain their perspective of their own world...of which, like it or mot, we are all a part of. My grand takeaway from this was rather...restrained? Dim? Hopeful?

This mini series is a spectacular piece of storytelling. It brings us into his evil world without glorifying him or making excuses. His father was always apologetic in a way that he wanted the recognition. Who could blame him really? Trying to take credit for the monster he nurtured. The mini series presents the people around him, from his family to his victims, to the people who suspected there was something wrong but didn't know exactly what, to the incompetent police (guess that never changes). At no point is dahmer made to be the anti hero or the one we should be rooting for. He was a very real monster who committed very real crimes and destroyed very real lives. I hope to think Ryan Murphy wanted to portray that in his writing.We all know how this ends but I was right there with the inmate who brought his justice. I felt like I understood his mind set and although I had tears in my eyes, none of them were for dahmer. I also knew what had happened to all his things but watching the actor who portrayed this benefactor and the disgust he displayed for those around him who were fascinated by dahmer, I was right there with him as well. Feeling disgust for all those people who viewed him as some sort of idol. Even now there are still fools who idolize him and it's disgusting.I cannot end without mentioning Niecy Nash's portrayal of the conflicted neighbor who didn't know how else to point to the monster next door.

Please be a little selfish of what you allow into your life, into your mind, into your bedroom. Life will give you a lot of good then."},{"id":"rw8587685","title":"Gritty Insight and Worth your Time","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"4 October 2022","text":"Dahmer is one of the better adaptations I've seen regarding a serial killer/true crime story. The way the story unfolds is often unsettling and unlike fiction, there are no positive character turns and the story just tells the atrocities of an entitled killer and the horrible things he did to so man people and their families. Dahmer does a great job and giving a very rounded view on how crimes like this effect society at large and how people like Dahmer should not be idolized. The show never tries to make him some sympathetic person that is just misunderstood. It lets him be the thing he was and that, unflinching in it's execution."},{"id":"rw8571755","title":"Outstanding acting","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"27 September 2022","text":"Whatever the wrongs and rights about this film being put out there .It's a compelling watch and incredibly well acted .From start to finish, it tells the true story of a madman .Surely one of the most vile men ever to have been born and left to commit his reign of terror .Thankfully some kind of justice was served on him in jail .Electric chair or something more inhuman would have been more fitting for this monster .The heinous crimes did happen though and deserves to be told in my opinion .And a story like this,is only valid if it's told with accuracy .For example \" Once in a lifetime in Hollywood \" is just a silly film for me and makes a mockery of the Tate killings .This sticks to much of what happened and that's what makes it compelling viewing."},{"id":"rw8591181","title":"Disturbing","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"6 October 2022","text":"Dahmer has a very good pilot, it entices the viewer by giving you a glimpse of the terror that Jeffrey Dahmer enflicted with a prolonged scene that was so creepy and filled with implications yet not violent at all. What I like most about this series is that it's not primarily about Jeffrey Dahmer, it's about the many people he affected. Constantly changing perspectives which made for a story that was very unpredictable. Evan Peters delivered a reserved yet great performance. Where this series falters is in its finale. It's not bad, it's just kind of underwhelming. I wanted more out of it. The character who wound up killing Dahmer felt very underdeveloped. Overall, this series is really good."},{"id":"rw8630748","title":"Monster","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"23 October 2022","text":"It's a good series as a series. Stunning. Production design and acting were very good. I knew about Dahmer, but he was someone I didn't research. What they did were very bad and terrible. In the last parts of the series, they brought the subject to unnecessary topics, but there was no need. As always, when someone like him occurred, first of all, their childhood and relationships with their parents are discussed, which I think was a very valid issue. What can we say about Dahmer? What they did was very bad and terrible. Of course, there would be some people who admired him. It intrigued me, but I'm not a fan of course. When the trailer of the series came out, it caught my attention and I added it to my watch list. But I didn't expect the series to be watched this much. For some reason, I lose my interest when it comes to a series or movie that suddenly became famous and watched a lot like Squid Game. So I waited a bit and passed it on. It's a good series, but I didn't like the way some subjects were handled."},{"id":"rw8694807","title":"More Propaganda","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"25 November 2022","text":"The highlight of the series is Richard Jenkins, playing the conflicted father who can't help loving his son no matter what dark deeds he has done. Other than that, things started off fine but slowly went downhill with more and more of the usual propaganda we get nowadays. What I found particularly irritating is a majority of the final few episodes features more and more of the supposed woman neighbour of Dahmer going through a lot of emotional \"pain\" and trauma, but she wasn't even a victim nor had any of her family or friends killed by Dahmer. What is this.. some kind of vicarious victimhood? Why spend so much time on her rather than on the actual victims' families who suffered real loss? I think this is very disrespectful and deserves to be roundly criticised."},{"id":"rw8579694","title":"Doing a Dahmer and doing it right.","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"1 October 2022","text":"If there is one thing to be said straight away about this series it was definitely a sinister and disturbing one. None the less its hard to find anything you can fault it on other then it wasn't necessarily %100 accurate, but for what its worth it hits the nail on the head. Not one actor felt out of place, everyone who played a serious role came off legitimate and believable. While Molly Ringwald is not in it as much she still plays her role respectively. Niecy Nash does a fantastic job as Glenda Cleveland and Richard Jenkins drives it home as Lional Dahmer, I would go as far to say he deserves a supporting actors nomination of sorts. Now who really brings home the bacon of course is none other then Evan Peters, definitely playing one of the best representations of someone in real life to cinema for 2022. This play by play documentary to limited Tv series is hands down a must watch and I would highly recommend it."},{"id":"rw8678018","title":"Evan Peters owns the role","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"16 November 2022","text":"Portraying a historical figure on the big screen is no easy feat - especially when it comes to a cannibalistic, necrophiliac serial killer whom the world hates with a burning vengeance.I've followed Evan Peters' acting career since I first saw him portraying Tate Langfon in AHS, so I've had a major boy crush on the hunk. Seeing him play Jeffrey Dahmer was a completely new experience, and a completely different role to Tate Langdon, but I found it was THE role Evan was made for. I can't imagine how intense it must have been for him to act as Dahmer, knowing what he did and all the heartache he's caused. There's no one else better for the role. He deserves to win an emmy for this."},{"id":"rw8616494","title":"Intriguing but painfully tedious too","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"17 October 2022","text":"Barring its fair share of inefficiencies, it is indeed a fascinating take on a wicked mind, a deeply affecting character study on a heinous perpetrator who had perpetrated some of the most unimaginable crimes and did unspeakable wrongs to not one but a dozen of innocent people. 'Dahmer' provides an intriguing perspective into a killer's crooked mentality, it sheds some light on his corrupted senses of what might be wrong and what might be right!Albeit the same parameters of judgment often got flooded with contradictory notions and a lack of respect and sympathy towards all the victims and their families. I noticed many had already spoken against the glorifying aspects of this particular portrayal and how it tries to instill empathy for the wrongdoer and I hereby raise my voice as well.You shouldn't at any expense glorify a vicious criminal like Jeffrey L. Dahmer. Yes, you can create Documentaries all you want; matter of fact, you should show us what exactly made him an aberration, inform other parents about the red flags, about the 'signs' they should be looking for in their children and their recurrent misdemeanors. But don't try to romanticize this stuff, trust me when I say this, there will be consequences beyond your control.P. S. Evan Peters, I hope you are not missing any of your therapy sessions, you need it, brother! A terrific enactment by the way, kudos!"},{"id":"rw8612801","title":"Ummmmm, wait a minute!","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"15 October 2022","text":"Amazing acting and compelling/disturbing story, but I can't help but feel I am no better than the people back in the day that sensationalized Jeffery Dahmer by supporting and watching this all in the name of entertainment.I'm sure this show will win awards and there will be thunderous applause, but it feels wrong. I can't imagine the families of the victims having to relive their nightmare while Netflix and all involved become wealthy and famous.The series did a perfect job at showing us just what kind of monster this man was and insight into his life, but as long as we continue to create and consume this type of content, his victims and their families will continue to be hurt over and over."},{"id":"rw8558654","title":"All of Nothing","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"21 September 2022","text":"Ryan Murphy is a prolific writer and maker of TV/Film. The problem is, there is no quality control. Just look at American Horror Story, some amazing starts to seasons and then it just coasts for 8 episodes until a finale. I would like Ryan to learn that less is more, maybe have a 3 one hour mini-season with a lot more quality rather than the bloated 10 episodes with not a lot going on.Dahmer is coasting during the first episode, a lot of fat could have been cut from this entire season. Some of the real events seem to have been merged into others and the emphasis on the kitsch nature of the fashion is front and centre.As usual, Style over Substance."},{"id":"rw8594976","title":"Disturbing, but Well Made","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"7 October 2022","text":"Prior to watching to this, I had seen a few documentaries about Dahmer. After seeing the great reviews, we decided to watch this. Yes, it can be slow at times, but there is a reason for that. This show follows the real story, from actual reports taken from Dahmer himself after he was arrested. Yes, it's disturbing what he did to these men, but I felt the directors and producers put this together as tastefully as they could given the events that happened. One thing that surprised me the most was the performance of Evan Peters. He was spot on playing Dahmer. He even got his voice down exactly! I don't know why people are up in their feelings about this. If you don't wanna watch a movie about Dahmer, don't push play! It's that easy. There are far worse shows out there. Evan Peters deserves an Emmy for this."},{"id":"rw8569646","title":"Mixed Feelings","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"26 September 2022","text":"It almost feels wrong to call it \"great\" or \"really good\" given what happened. I spent many of the scenes thinking of how would the victims families feel about so much horrific detail in specific scenes. It almost feels exploitative at times of the victims and their families.On the other hand, I believe it's also one of the best directed and acted (Evan Peters) series I have ever seen. The feel of the show is hard to put into words, Horrifying, Jaw-dropping or Chilling? Either way you cannot stop watching. The Negative reviews about the series being too long or slow are rubbish. Part of the reason the show is rating so highly is due to the depth they go into for some scenes, something that likely wouldn't have been achieved over a series with 4 episode or the like.I'm not sure the show should have been made but ultimately it was and is now out there. Therefore, it deserves a 10 for what it is, whether it should have been made is a separate issue."},{"id":"rw8570743","title":"At a loss for words.","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"26 September 2022","text":"I expected a charismatic, manipulative Evan Peters as the cannibalistic Jeff coming into the show. We got that, but it was portrayed in a way that took the focus from Jeff and showed the pain and chaos that were derived from his actions. It painted serial killers as they should be, monsters. Kevin and Niecey were both SPECTACULAR. Kevin's performance as Lionel Dahmer, will go down in my book as one of the best performances of my lifetime. When he walked into the room and the medical examiner pulled the cloth from Jeff's face, I BELIEVED him. When his head popped to the side and frowned, I believed he was a father who just saw their dead son's body. SUPERB."}]
