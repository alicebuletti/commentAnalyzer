[{"id":"rw9579983","title":"season 4 recap","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"22 January 2024","text":"All in le head.I'd leave it at that but IMDb doesn't allow such short reviews, so i'll elaborate - especially on why i give such a high rating as compared to my hatred for the trope of \"crazy character who thinks he's not crazy imagined half of what you saw\". It's easy viewing. Its engaging and the three times i have watched it seasons 1-3 i have been amused even when im doing other things on the side and not quite paying attention. Even through that i manage to get dragged in, pause whatever i'm doing and just stare. The visuals can be captivating and sometimes the payoffs are visceral and astounding. Season 1 can work to make you forget just how disgusting and horrible what joe is doing is but beck, along with the viewer, finding the box will never fail to grip me. That being said, for all its good i cant remember a single thing, a single character name, a single dynamic from season 4. It jumped the shark. All i remember is \"joe was just being a bit goofy and imagining a politician is also a murderer and wants to know joe n become murder pals\" and thats really heart breaking.Here's to hoping season 5 will be better."},{"id":"rw9505942","title":"Pretty good","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"20 December 2023","text":"I gave 8 just because of the first 2 seasons that were very good. The third was decent, but pretty unbelievable, how can you fall in love with a person that have the same hobby, killing people. And he evan was blaiming Love for being a bad pers on. I don t even want to talk about the fourth, I couldn t even finish it. The plot is very weak, it is like they have no idea how to continue it. I m curious if they can do better with the next season. Penn is a good actor, played so good that stalker and sociopath character and I hope that they will not destroy that serie like they did with many others."},{"id":"rw9489401","title":"Why you should watch 'You'?","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"11 December 2023","text":"This show pulled me in from the start and made me binge it. The filter, songs used, direction of the plot and Pen Badgely's acting were few of the reasons that made this show one of my favourites.Most of the time the last few minutes of an episode creates curiosity and makes me wonder what happens next and hence the binge-watching.The main protagonist Joe Goldberg, is an interesting character to break down because he represents some of our darkest desires. Questions like how far would you go for love, is shown by him and it also made me reflect on my potential too. Also would you kill a person when they find out your dark past?PS: Joe Goldberg's humour is very funny."},{"id":"rw9461992","title":"Not Dexter","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"28 November 2023","text":"I only watch DexterI cannot for the life of me understand the praise some people have heaped on this show. It's just about a dumb lanky manchild with childhood trauma. And the fandom sucks so bad, they're all a bunch of edgy teenage cornballs trying to romanticize mental illnesses like BPD. They also ignore literally everything about the show and just focus on irrelevant BS like the romance in the show, while ignoring all the other aspects of the story. Do some of you really have such low standards that THIS is what is considered a great show to you? You guys would probably bust a nut if you ever sat down and watched something like Dexter (peak, best show of all time ofc)"},{"id":"rw9460454","title":"Amazing, in its own way.","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"27 November 2023","text":"I love how in the show obsession and love sometimes don't mix well, and how amazingly it's portrayed.It also shows the backstory of the main character, who's the root of the problems to cause a slight understanding whilst still being mysterious.Though Joe made some bad decisions, he can be seen as a good character based on the portrayal and story, his doings might be bad but in his head he was doing it for the good, or what he thought was good.Also proves the saying 'you fall in love with the imaginary person not the real one' right.Overall, great show, has some ups and downs.Monologue👌"},{"id":"rw9439277","title":"Meh","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"17 November 2023","text":"It's kinda just average, I don't really understand how this is a thriller. It kinda has the same vibes as Barry to me (which isn't a thriller), but worse. Also, some of the episodes are just so awful it ruins the whole season (i.e. S1 E7/8). Was bored out of my mind, especially with that whole therapy plot, turned into a total romance-drama. Also Joe's character was truly just a mindless copy and paste villain, no redeeming qualities, no intriguing backstory, simply typical, mindless and boring.Overall would not recommend, although the show has some good moments, majority of the time you will be bored (if you are looking for a thriller). But if you want a dark romance-drama with \"some\" thriller moments, it's okay."},{"id":"rw9437338","title":"Monotone poker voice","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"16 November 2023","text":"Joe narrative point of view. Don't like. Don't want. Doesn't do a good job of narration thoughts intentions feelings. Morgan Freeman Shawshank or Henry Hill Goodfellas narrator is the best. Even spider man narrating is fun. Is beck dumb. Is joe too smart. Is American psycho better. You tv show based on book.Everyone should have been narrating in the show. Maybe would help. Bookstore movie like tom hanks bookshop movie was good. How does Joe not die. Is everyone dumb. Should have been a new lead per season like desperate housewives. How about Dexter was Smart. I haven't seen Dexter. I like X files."},{"id":"rw9434354","title":"Old-time antagonists are modern day protagonists!","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"14 November 2023","text":"The psychological thrillers have a way to creep inside your brain. Though I watch and take time to understand, I maintain a healthy distance from it. The series is a perfect example of our times where we accept an antagonist to lead the show. The psych of it is difficult to understand but we all have our vices that drives us closer to an antagonist first. We try to find a way to associate and indulge with the character unless the scenario compels us to hate it. This series does a really good job of keeping the antagonist as human as required.Joe Goldberg is an obsessive character that dwells on people's lives to finally imbibe it. The obsession to find the perfect \"You\" and have self-indulgence is not a new concept. We all do at times but for different or better reasons. Here the character arc of Joe Goldberg (played by Penn Badgely), in its obsession of finding \"You\", is so designed that it covers all the stages of a character development. Each season starts with a back story of recovering from a past trauma, pushing the character into a wilderness of its own to find a new \"You\", getting wrapped in the potholes of own doing, and finally ending on a success note to keep the motivation up. In fact, the entire romanticism in the movie making is based on it and so it's instantly relatable. The character arc makes us believe in the antagonist as the show's protagonist.The series creators Greg Berlanti and Sera Gamble have created great shows in the past but I think Sera's adaptation of Caroline Kepnes' writing is excellent. I could see the traits of \"Supernatural\" in it with all the televised twists and turns. Caroline Kepnes is known for her novel \"Providence\" where she maintains the supernatural angle but Sera has adapted that beautifully and in her own style. Greg does bring the charm of Flash and Arrow to drive the show by introducing different characters at a pace. The writing just works well with all of them teaming up together.I'm not sure if the story or the novel ends with season four. The pattern reveals it differently. In odd numbered seasons (one and three), the character of \"You\" dies whereas in even numbered seasons (two and four), the character \"You\" survives. But, then the fourth season also surprises us by not killing the past and the current season's love interest. Interestingly, the survival of the characters of two \"You\"s is something new but could also mean that the story could end here meaning that Joe Goldberg has finally overcome his obsessiveness for \"You\". It sure is a meaningful end to his character without disturbing the series' balance. We will have to wait and see if we get a surprising fifth installment of this successful psychopathic journey."},{"id":"rw9387511","title":"Could do without season 4","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"21 October 2023","text":"I loved this tv series, up until season 4 (more on that later).The series in itself is amazing and seems super unique, a man who believes in love but loves obsessively to an unhealthy degree is great. There's parts in the series that completely catch you off guard and that's what I love about it. It doesn't skip out on the little details either, I mean they really made the character Joe feel loveable yet threatening.Season 1 was a good introduction to show how far Joe with go for the one he's obsessively in love with. Season 2 was amazing and we finally see him in a relationship where he seems to have calmed down (but we all know that seasonal twist). Season 3 seemed very up and down for me, there's parts that I love and parts I hate. Season 4 however wasn't great at all and ruined the ending."},{"id":"rw9383636","title":"I just don't get the appeal","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"18 October 2023","text":"You know... There's not many movies or shows that makes me as irationally angry as 'You' does, I just don't get why it's gotten so popular or why it has so many seasons, we're just following a total creep who... I don't even know if we supposed to like or not, sure, unlikable protagonists are a thing but Joe never truly gets punished for what he does.Hell, he evens gets a girlfriend as crazy as him and I just wanna ask... Why ? Do people actually enjoy this ? If so, is it because they find it thrilling or because they think it's funny for some reason ? I don't know, but I personally don't enjoy watching about stuff that happens to an alarming amount of women in real life in the eyes of the freak who does it to them, not like this anyways and I find it concerning that one of the genres of this show is \"romance\" on here."},{"id":"rw9369307","title":"Love is dangerous","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"10 October 2023","text":"I think it is more of a crime series than a romance.Maybe the main focus of the series is about love, but love is just an excuse.It was interesting how a person goes after his love or wants to get it, but is it possible to do anything in the name of love?The fact that sometimes the past of the main character was vaguely displayed in the series was a positive point.But in my opinion, sometimes some parts of the series were disgusting.I also got some good points about the power of social networks and how they are a source of information for us.My favorite part was that the main character is a book reader, but I have to say that he doesn't seem to have learned from books at all.The important issue that the series showed very well was that it did not define the border between being good and being bad, that is, you felt that the main character was both a monster and sometimes a good person, and that was the important point, and sometimes it was confusing."},{"id":"rw9344570","title":"A Missed Opportunity: \"You\" Falls Short on Realism and Character Depth","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"27 September 2023","text":"\"You\" aims to be a psychological thriller that delves into the dark corners of obsession and love, but it often misses the mark due to its lack of realism and poorly constructed characters. While the show does offer moments of suspense, these are overshadowed by glaring plot holes and character choices that defy logic.One of the most jarring examples is the protagonist, Beck, who lives her life with an almost reckless disregard for privacy. Her apartment is a stalker's dream-no curtains, fully transparent windows, and a view that offers a direct look into her most intimate moments. This isn't just a minor oversight; it's a fundamental flaw that makes the suspense feel unearned. In an age where privacy is a major concern, Beck's lack of basic security measures like curtains or even a simple password on her phone and laptop feels not just naive but implausible.The script doesn't do the characters any favors either. The dialogue often feels forced and clichéd, making it hard to invest in the characters or their relationships. No one talks or acts the way people do in real life, which adds another layer of disconnect. Conversations that are meant to be deep or revealing come off as contrived, pulling the viewer out of the moment.Moreover, the show sets up situations that are far too convenient for Joe, the stalker. From Beck's aforementioned lack of privacy measures to her friends who spill secrets all too easily, everything seems to align perfectly for Joe's manipulative plans. It's as if the universe conspires to make his stalking endeavors as straightforward as possible, which undermines the tension and makes the unfolding drama feel artificial.While \"You\" does have its moments-thanks to some decent performances and a premise that could have been intriguing-the show ultimately fails to deliver a believable or compelling narrative. It's a missed opportunity, one that could have been much more impactful with a bit more attention to character development and a touch of realism."},{"id":"rw9318302","title":"Season 1&2 amazing, 3 good, 4 unenjoyable full and hard to get through","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"11 September 2023","text":"Season one and two were amazing absolutely loved these two seasons, very addictive and Penn is fantastic. Likeable characters great addictive plot. Was complete hooked, was unpredictable. Season Three was good but not brilliant, was very forgettable. Season four was dull, unlikable cast, poor story line and completely lost interest half way through. Cannot bare Kate as every episode poor acting and very unlikable.

No one else could have played Joe Goldberg; Penn Badgely sheds his dopey performance as Dan Humphrey in Gossip Girl for a mind bending unharmonious mix of perverse logic and narcissistic delusion. But I've never been so engaged to watch an entire season of something in one sitting than I was for YOU.On the outside, Joe Goldberg is a quiet, hopeless romantic spending his days working as bookstore clerk in New York City. But to his very core, he is a controlling and manipulative boyfriend with a secret criminal history going back farther than he can remember. He spends his time in desperate pursuit of love, but has such a twisted misunderstanding of the concept he will stop at nothing until he finds The One.Each season separated itself from the one previous with an endless character turnover rate that constantly changes the tone of the series, but never Joe's persistent, unhinged internal monologue. His dark humor and lack of self awareness regularly leaves the audience torn on who to root for, because he does have a deep misunderstanding of morals in many aspects, yet goes out of his way to help strangers in need and the neglected son of his neighbor.It's difficult to explain the personality of the show on paper and, in my opinion, requires giving the first episode a chance and I highly recommend hanging on tight for the second season which blows the first out of the water."},{"id":"rw9300071","title":"YOU Review","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"2 September 2023","text":"This show is unlike anything I've watched before. I was hooked and binged all 4 seasons in 2-3 weeks. I had some uneasy feelings as I watched it, sometimes I felt for some of the characters, I definitely think it portrays how a stalker would think and act in real life really well, especially when they become obsessive. Seemed slightly redundant in the middle of the seasons, sometimes things seemed a little far fetched but it is a show after all. Season 4 was a rough start and took me a bit to get into it, but I actually enjoyed the last few episodes of it and interested to see how they end it with Season 5."},{"id":"rw9259030","title":"To The Amazement of Audience","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"14 August 2023","text":"As the series You captured remarkable attention in the the first three sessions, progression of the 4th was more like a detective style which bores the watcher. However, it thrives to catch attention to the surprise of the watcher. Even though it takes long time to watch the story progression it is definitely worth to wait to be satisfied. It reaches to its best where it is most boring. Even though first half of the story is not the style of You which we have gotten used, the ambience of London adds authentic scenery. There is a reason why they keep longer beginning of story. This prepares the audience more astonished toward to the end. Even though some aspects seems exaggerated, the feeling of amazement it gives cover up these aspects and makes you think they suit to the story. This is when you think, that's the You I expect to watch, giving fun moments by going around the edges."},{"id":"rw9258205","title":"Heart breaking Ending in season 3","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"13 August 2023","text":"Its really heart breaking to see die love quinn at the end. Really miss her on the show.\"You\" is a gripping psychological thriller that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with its intense storytelling and compelling characters. The series masterfully explores the dark side of modern relationships and the dangers of obsession in the age of technology. Penn Badgley's portrayal of the enigmatic and unsettling Joe Goldberg is both chilling and captivating, making it impossible to look away from his twisted journey. The writing is sharp, filled with unexpected twists, and the suspenseful atmosphere adds to the overall appeal. However, it's important to note that \"You\" deals with mature and disturbing themes, so it may not be suitable for all audiences. If you enjoy suspenseful dramas with complex characters and aren't easily unnerved, this series is definitely worth a watch. Just be prepared for some intense and thought-provoking moments."},{"id":"rw9253169","title":"Truly, a masterpiece.","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"11 August 2023","text":"To tell the truth I struggled to keep up with season 4 of the show as I found it completely out of space compared to the previous 3 seasons and the main concept of the series. Apart from that I have to admit that having watched and loved all those previous 3 seasons (especially the 1st and the 2nd ones) the first 5- 6 episodes of the 4th season were quite dull and slow. I am happy I didn't stop watching midshow though- after episode 6 there's a massive breakthrough there.Season 4 isn't a murder mystery as all viewers thought it would be, things never did take this turn. It was just Joe, who managed to manipulate the audience too! Loved it."},{"id":"rw9252463","title":"Quite intriguing honestly","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"11 August 2023","text":"I was browsing for a new series that can let me captivated and here I stumbled onto this, a pretty good plot and story that kept me going and wanting for more. Simply because as a viewer, I'd want to know what is the protagonist's next move and trying to differentiate between illusion and reality all at once is rather good approach to keep me satiated in a good series.The story was very well developed in my humble opinion as it slowly unravel the deeper side of the protagonist. The supporting characters were also well plotted and designed for to better elevate the main character's scheming and yet witty personality. Honestly I think if I were to describe the main character in one word, that would be psychotic! Ostensibly displayed through the main character's personas and his smart planning with his exit strategy.Strongly recommended for anyone who likes crime and thrillers for this series. It's indeed exhilarating in every suspense it brought me and now I'm looking forward for the finale in 2024 for Season 5 (accordingly to some googled articles)."},{"id":"rw9216728","title":"I adore this, favourite series of all time","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"26 July 2023","text":"Great everything.I love Joe, I love how he's so passionate about stuff, like his books and his lovers. Talking about his lovers, I love them. They're all so different from each other and beautiful in their own way.I love that Joe is so \"evil\" or \"murderess\" (or whatever you want to call him), and yet, so funny. I also read that he's not a sociopath or a psychopath, which I first thought, but that he has an antisocial personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, and I found that interesting because he is really good at pleasing people socially and pleasing their egos. He knows exactly what he needs to say to make the other feel better or make them do what he wants. I loved that he can manipulate people so easily, too.I loved it so much that I'm rewatching the whole thing, and I even loved it so much that I'm reading the books now. I just finished the first one two days ago or something, and I'm already reading the second part.

Penn Badgley is absolutely amazing at portraying this role, especially because he hates it so much, since the main character also somewhat despises himself. The plot every season is absolutely great, but the latest season pushed me into having doubts here and there. It was so murder mystery-like which I didn't understand at first. But as the show progressed more and more, the more I understood the means and the aspects of the show. The plot, however, was extremely predictable with each season. Maybe not in detail, but roughly, in its entirety, predictable."},{"id":"rw9198910","title":"Couldn't see more that 5 episodes","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"18 July 2023","text":"It started well, interesting, well made, but slowly transformed into a wreak show. Impossible things that you try to ignore because it's a show, I know, but after a while you are \"come on man...\", uninteresting drama between characters that you don't know and care that much and a few more. Just imagine a really popular guy got killed and no one cares to look for him. Everyone is obsessed with a not-so-beautiful, not interesting, average girl in New York that sleeps with you if you ask her if she has tattoos, because she doesn't have tattoos, probably it was a joke there...Not worth it in my opinion, lost my time with 5 episodes."},{"id":"rw9147602","title":"Season 4 completely jump the shark!","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"26 June 2023","text":"Please for the love of God do not make a season 5! Season 4 completely jumped the shark! What the hell was this season anyway? I was on board with the campy whodunit plot line, even though Joe's character would absolutely never be accepted into the elitist socialite circle that we are supposed to believe he is now a part of. But I went with it. Then there's a plot twist (that I won't give away). It turned into a completely different show altogether. A show that, honestly I completely lost interest in. Writers have made it impossible to continue rooting for Joe! Season 1, even season 2 the audience is rooting for him! But the writers have lost that sense of direction. It's almost like they didn't quite know what to do with Joe, maybe feeling that they had to switch it up in order to keep being renewed for multiple seasons. Well that's not working for me, personally anymore. Not to mention that Joe's character is completely 100% creepy! Creepier than he was in the first couple of seasons. Yeah, I know he's supposed to be creepy. But he's really just down right gross! I hung with season 4 pretty well until around episode 7 or 8 when the show just became laughable and I became frustratingly bored and skeeved out. At that point I went online and read the summaries for the remaining episodes. I left the show on in the background as I scrolled social media and just waited for it to end."},{"id":"rw9147243","title":"Might be my first ever \"1/10\"","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"26 June 2023","text":"I think I never gave a 1/10 to any show, ever. All have some merits. \"You\" is a totally different beast. And got to make a major spoiler to make my point. So if you want to try to give this show a shot, stop reading.Just watched the first season and the begining of season 2 but had to stop. I couldn't stand the main character, \"Joe\" and the plot twists piling up went too far.The whole story gravitates around this hideous Joe, a stalker-sociopath, that has nothing that could make him remotely likeable. He is obsessed with finding \"the one true love\". Pretty soon finds a \"victim/target\". And you are told that he had an ex girlfriend that misteriously disappeared. He has no particular \"moral\" pseudo-justification like Dexter (another character I cannot stand, but am not a fan of these types of shows in any way shape or form, so I might be biased).However, it started in a pormising way. The \"internal dialogues\", the locations and the first few episodes seemed interesting. The fact that you are dealing with a seriously disturbed character becomes clear pretty fast. But you could still believe there might be some kind of evolution or redemption somewhere along the way. Soon enought the whole thing becomes pretty predictable and then you have the final episode of season 1, which tells a lot about how dumb the writers think the audience is.During season 1, for a series of events both the main character and his new found love obsession end up going to the same therapist. The show hints that they actually talked estensively of their respective sentimental lives. The only difference in the narrative is that Joe, to \"disguise\" his identity, claims to be gay in a relationship with another man. However, a few scenes show that the stories the two tell the therapist are simmetrical. And the events of their love life totally match. How could the therapist not have any kind of hint that most likely the main character was lying on the identity of his partner?The twist of the show unfortunately relies on this flaw in the story. After killing his girl friend, as expected, he manages to frame the therapist (its more nuanced, the girl friend actually helps him, but that is the bottom line). The therapist is a totally unaware moron? Really bad at his job? Horrible defence attorney? Or are we to believe that, being married, the guilt for being unfaithful is enought to wanting to spend the rest of his life in prison for murder? On top of that, no one is surprised by the number of disappearances and murders surrounding the main character?Maybe I missed something, maybe the show answers these questions later on. I might never know. But that was too much for me. So, besides the oppressing atmosphere, the strong feeling of wanting to beat the living s*** out of Joe, the story unfortunately just falls apart.1/10 because, besides hating everything about this \"Joe\" guy and the glorification of sociopaths, I feel the \"framing the therapist\" part is just far too weak to be believable."},{"id":"rw9140500","title":"Hidden Gem on Netflix","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"23 June 2023","text":"Season 1: 6/10Season 2: 8/10Season 3: 7/10Season 4: 4/10Overall rating: 7/10You is one of those shows that is gritty, dark, and keeps you on edge every episode. Although most of Joe's acting comes from his thoughts, Penn Badgley does a fantastic job at being a psychopath. He's funny, uncomfortable and really makes you hooked by his unreliable narration. For me personally, season 1 was okay what really stood out was how interesting Joe's character was presented. Season 2 was by far my favorite, there is a lot more interesting characters and in my opinion just more memorable episodes. Season 3 isn't liked by many but I actually enjoyed this season a lot. It puts Joe in a spot that I always wondered what if or what would happen if he was put into a more responsible person. Season 4 is by far the worst, not many interesting or likable characters. A lot of episodes don't feel like it progresses anything but still an interesting setting for Joe to be in.

I only watch shows to be entertained, and this one fits the bill. A serial killer that you can love.

But you are not guessing for too long, because that mystery will be solved, but then there is immediately another mystery. I have never seen this actor or any of the other actors before. They are all very good. I will be looking up other shows they have been in to watch."},{"id":"rw9120916","title":"Too good to pass up on","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"14 June 2023","text":"Once again i am left amazed and shocked by the immaculate writing of this series. Season four was every bit as compelling as the rest of them and though the plot seems to be stretching towards a dangerous path it thankfully doesnt stray from what 'you' have always been about. Joe Golberg is an obsessive man with a savior complex who has struggled to find love. Continiously throughout his life the people meant to love him failed him, and in his pursuit of love he is helplessly trying to perfect his romantic relationships so as to not be left alone once more. It is compelling to see his character development through the series, going from somebody who rationalized his wrong doings by calling them acts of love (when really he controlled, manipulated and isolated his victims) to somebody who accepts the darkest parts of himself yet still fails to truly correct or fully embrace them. There is still a long way to go for this beautifully developed and flawed man (perharps a little too flawed) to give us a definite and fulfilling ending. 'You' I think puts into perspective what is considered good and bad, it keeps testing what is supposed to be enough of an acts of redemption and -of course- revealing just what love can do, but what it can also turn to. Joe's partners have a lot to reveal about this subject in particular, not only by exploring the couple's chemistry every time but also by showing various forms of love and affection that aid or not Joe in his pursuit of hapinness. I will say that sometimes one has to dig deeper to realise the full extent of all the aforementioned, and especially in the last season it is easy to get lost with the alleged stalker that joe suddenly acquires. Some might think it favors its dramatic thriller elements over its psycological insight and social commentary, but stick long enough with it, and season 4 doesnt fail to deliver both of those elements. Perhaps in a little too gorey and more confusing than ever way, the viewer really gets a taste of joe's mind, and fights with him the true enemy, himself. Still, that takes a good few episodes, and in that time joe feels more like a detective in an agatha cristie novel. Enjoyable, but not what i originally had come to 'you' for (though i will say that its kinda funny seeing a person who has commited atrocious acts play the 'good' role in such a scenario). How the season continued absolutely blew my mind, with the grand reveal i was stunned, reaching for a tissue. It made joe look more human than ever. To quote one of my favorite and most questionable characters of the season - rhys monrose - the longer you spend with someone, the more you are cursed to see them as human, and joe felt every bit of that this season. I am utterly conflicted, surprised but also appauled, melancholic but also victorious, in awe and... terrified. The scene that definetely had me on a chokehold was joe finally comforting his past, comforting himself, accepting what and who he is and his inevitable end that was really not what i had expected. I cannot wait for season five hoping to see Joe now that he has unlocked his full potential, stronger and terrifying as ever. (i will go into more detail about s4 so the rest of my review is a spoiler) Still joe cannot get all the recognition, the supporting characters, as insufferable as some of them might have been, were the perfect distraction for the plot to move forward but also a great social commentary. The eat the rich killer, the erotomanic lady, the devastating end of phoebe's and adam's relationships, they were all perfectly executed and had me emotionally invested in all of them. I especially loved the role of rhys, which in the end just proved to be joe. I feel like joe's delusion should have been a little more obvious and the worry for marienne more present in the whole series rather than only adressed in the last few episodes. I wished rhys had stopped looking like rhys at the end, that final scene at the brigde, and turned perhaps into a younger joe. That hug after joe's heartaching confession, when he finally tolf himself he loved him, that all he did was to protect him and that after all that he was comforted by the person he needed him most, himself, was exactly what joe needed to hear as a child, as a teenager and especially at the time where our story started, when he became interested in candance. It made me cry. It was the climax, what every single narration penn badgley had to record led to, and it was beautiful. I could never have asked for more. It was dissapointing to see all the developmenmt joe went through have no real result after that scene, where he wakes up in the hospital and kate tells him she still loves him. I feel like she was not the motivation he needed to be good, seeing what happened to nadia and eric (i will absolutely never forgive joe for them). Still kate and joe just make sense, i thought Love was the one joe was looking for but perhaps its somebody like kate, who doesnt ignore his flaws but instead accepts them, shows him her own dark parts without endorsing them, and through it all being the good person he's always wanted to love and be loved by. I'll miss phoebe and i'm excited for what marienne and nadia will do next (s4 also made me appreciate marienne more and truly wish the best for her)"},{"id":"rw9115896","title":"Oregon has grown up and S4 is a return to form for You","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"12 June 2023","text":"Fresh Meat is among my favourite comedies. Charlottle Ritchie who played 'Oregon' in that show reminded me of happy go lucky, impressionable friends I had a uni. In You season 4 it's confronting to see her being such a hard, cynical character now. This is what time can do to us, or perhaps it's just a testament to her acting. You season 4 is a dark, intriguing and exciting return to form. Brilliant change of direction & setting. The writing is excellent as usual. Makes me think I should read the books it is based on. Season 3 kind of lost me with Joe going on men's retreats and such. Overall one of the best shows on Netflix.

Great concept, good acting, good storyline. Badgley's acting was good and it helped sell the story. Many episodes ended on great cliff-hangers and it made it binge-worthy.However, I was let down by the last two seasons. They seemed bizarre, confusing, out of place and wildly exaggerated (especially in season four). It was a lovely surprise to see Charlotte Ritchie as she's a fav but the story was still very weak.

In this season we see how Joe (who changed his name and started a new life again) tries to leave the murderous, manipulative, obsessive, stalker Joe in the past, we see how he tries hard to be a better person, however we see in the second part how he dissociates having another personality (his bad psychopathic personality, which at the end of the season we see is stronger than his desire to improve (because he really is a psychopath-psychopath), since he dissociates into the murderer of the famous which takes the appearance of a politician-writer who follows and with which he identifies. It is a season with a lot of psychological-psychiatric component, in other seasons we have been seeing how Joe's childhood traumas made him what he is today, Since not having received adequate help caused everything that he is, Joe Psychology In this season we can see a Joe who is afraid, who is more vulnerable, who wants to be a normal person but cannot achieve it. At first I liked that he was not It was based only on a relationship or on someone liking it, however it is not hard, the season manages to maintain its essence. In the end, the truth is, I didn't expect him to do that to his student. The bad thing about the season: Kate's character was not my favorite, she seemed very flattened to me, she is also a bit crazy since she accepted Joe with his \"truths\" and I developed a very fast relationship with him, I feel that she can become a Love, the characters of the millionaires (with the exception of Lady Phoebe who was really my favorite of them because she was not bad, just that they used her and took advantage of her), I would have liked to know a little more about Malcolm's history and nadia."},{"id":"rw9094808","title":"The longer you watch less you get","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"2 June 2023","text":"After I watched the first seson, I felt this series have a message.

The premise is utterly pedestrian, with such a lack of suspense and thrill. Granted, I was only able to watch two episodes before I couldn't take the boredom any longer. But most other shows I've watched that started off a bit dule, after two eps, things picked up and something in the story ends up drawing me in. That definitely did not happen here. I typically don't mind the slow pacing, I prefer when characters are fully fleshed out and the story is explored properly. However, the painstakingly slow pace in this show is not helping its case. Both the main characters are very uninteresting. The woman is naive and pathetic. And the guy is just moronic.

It's not like Dexter where Dexter generally kills only the \"deserving\", but there are some similarities. So much so that the show itself makes a tongue and cheek joke about it.The acting really is top notch. It's done at a great level by the cast, and mastered by the likes of Victoria, Penn, Elizabeth and James just to name a few.Season 4 was a bit of a let down but with season 5 still to come, I'm hoping to see a final season with a mixture of closure and greatness."},{"id":"rw9060644","title":"Created an account just to say","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"17 May 2023","text":"That this is one of the worst series i ever saw.

There are some too easy conclusions to plot developments, but well it could be worst. Grabs a bit of attention and that's what it is all about, producers aren't aiming for something groundbreaking: it's a teen thriller movie plot about a stalker turned into a series. I just don't quite understand why movies like that get a 5.3 average rating and this series a 7.7! Main actor's cute face and Gossip Girl past role I would guess.

The story though was ridiculous and unrealistic. Not only does the protagonist Joe get away with stalking and killing people when forensic evidence would clearly point right at him, (urine in the jar), but his way out of it is a book that Beck wrote? There's literally no proof she actually wrote it, as it was typed, and any half wit would be able to put the pieces together. There's also a ton of plot holes. You can't continue to view texts on an old phone when the user activates a new one. Joe seems to have no problems understanding conversations out of hearing range when he's hiding. You also can't just walk into a mansion in Greenwich, CT. As a former Fed Ex driver who delivered in that town, those huge houses have security gates and alarms. Just ridiculous.Some of the characters were simply unrealistic and it was blatantly obvious the actor who played Blythe is a man. Doesn't even look like a female. Elizabeth Lail was great as Beck, but her character was whorish and very nieve and dumb. And at the end Paco was hugely disappointing. He hates Joe and then sees him straight up murder a guy and decides to keep it hushed up and also fails to save Beck and doesn't even say anything after her sudden death.

Well, maybe the story goes in circles, but the scene is still nice and the LA-stupidity kind of entertaining.I can't even describe who terrible the 4th season is. Joe, so I won't bother.

The second half descends into a little bit of a mess.Season Two: the acting is elevated, and you enjoy some wonderful performances bringing unique characters into the series. However, there are some plot arrangements that really asks you for suspension of reality.Season Three: this was my favorite season. Good actors are complemented with tension between the two main characters through their dangerous relationship. I have little criticism for Season Three.Season Four: the first half was fun! A murder mystery wraps you into the series and keeps you guessing. The latter half descends into a mess that makes little sense.All in all, the charm of the actors, the characters they bring to life, the narration by the villainous protagonist are wonderful elements... but it's not perfect due to some dubious plot choices and arrangements."},{"id":"rw8970608","title":"Season 4 Nadia is beyond belief","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"4 April 2023","text":"This young college student seems to know what up and takes all of a few minutes to get into Joe's apt, then soon discovers the key, and her friend sends her phone pics of Joe holding a Indian restaurant bag and then she searches a dilapidated old building and then goes by herself in the creepy dungeon type basement and finds the door the ket fits.

Keeps. Going. Basically, every other character introduced - he's gonna unalive them at some point. Not to mention when he finds a wife who's apparently even worse. The inconsistency of the characters is painful as well. So many things left unexplained. I'm also missing the thrill of being 'worried' is someone's gonna find out - because, for every crime he committs, he finds a solution in the next episode and off he goes to another one. I want to be worried he'll be busted at least a little longer after the wrongdoing. Not to mention how unreal it is that he got away with so many crimes. Too bad since it looked like it had a potential at the beginning. Should probably mention that I stopped somewhere during season 3, no clue what happens later on.

He was smart enough to build a soundproof plexiglass cage with nannycams around it in the past 3 seasons but somehow can't stop or spy on a man from breaking and entering his own apartment SIX times in six episodes now.

The writing is smarmy and soaked in the unrealistic, smug conversation that too many of modern series seem to have adopted (Yellowstone).

The settings, the accents and the slang kept me wanting more from each episode.The ridiculousness of the ultra rich's actions was enhanced by Joe's ability to get off the hook, time and time again. I think what's so great about it this is that it's so out of touch for the vast majority of us. Most of us don't have country houses. We're not hosting substance fuelled murder mystery parties because we can. We don't hide people away, blackmail one another and kill targets because we have to. But we're aware that people do. We're aware people do horrific things. We're aware the ultra rich can get away with virtually anything, because money rules. Always.Everything about this is so silly that it's just about believable to think that this could genuinely be a reality. That's why I love this season in particular.There's also the acting.

I loved this character, i felt his sadness/quest for love and i felt sorry about him and what he's been through, even though he commits unforgivable things. Penn Badgley is amazing, this is one of the best actor's performances of the last decade. Elizabeth Lail and Victoria Pedretti were astonishing too. Yes, there were similarities with DEXTER but still, this was fresh/original/creative, focused on more human-relations stuff, whereas DEXTER was more action-packed, with crimes, police etc. I liked first season slightly better but the second was glorious too.Third season lost a step but still this was one of the GOAT tv shows of the last decade.Fourth season maybe ruined this show. Still entertaining as hell, hence the 7 stars. Still, acting was top notch. And there were some intriguing twists and turns. But, in the end of the day, Jo Goldberg is no more recognizable. These writers don't have a clue. Seriously, hire the previous writers again. Furthermore, this show was always over the top and kinda unrealistic, however, 4th season is one of the most unplausible TV seasons of all time. Lazy writing.

Parents are abusive or want children just for their image. Being a serial killer or a stalker is faced as something usual etc. So we don't talk about a thriller but maybe about a social drama presented in a soap opera way??I am not sure about it the only thing I know is that this is not a thriller since it is completely predictable and there are no detectives or police or crime investigations. The only scary thing is that maybe people like this are around us...And excuse me this is not a picture of nowadays society we are not all of us so pathetic or addicted to social medias. We like social media as a way of enjoying ourselves however we have real friends,good parents and good husbands or wives. Moreover it is not so easy to commit so many murders and nobody realizes the truth or find so easily everything just by surfing the Net. It becomes unrealistic that is why seems silly many timesThis série has focused only on the mentally sick people so it becomes unbearable.1st season started interestingly so did the 4th but they ended ridiculously.

I think she is just written this way.Also while I enjoy balance between rich and poor, left and right, and so on... there is kind of wokism added in seasons 4, at least in Nadia and maybe in Kate.Let's hope season 5 will be good."},{"id":"rw8952819","title":"Ridiculous, entertaining, but unforgivably political","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"26 March 2023","text":"This is like a total unrealistic rollercoaster of a storyline, but very entertaining if it's not realism that you are after.Unfortunately any show that tries to project propaganda and politics of any kind automatically gets a low score from me, no matter how good the show is.

Same story, different location. No additional creativity. No difference from the seasons before. Joe wants to change. Joe has to change. Nothing is Joe's fault. Joe finds new love that will change him forever. Whooooops! People die but Jow is never suspected as the killer, even though he is the common denominator in each of these situations. Probably also should've gotten a bigger, stronger character to play someone who can overpower any and everyone he has ever faced.The first few seasons were good, but this season was a \"2\" for me.

All these rich spoiled brats and their annoying personalities.... God... I can't describe my frustration and boredom. All the unnecessary drama and people made me really tired. There's not even one likeable character in this season. I didn't feel bad for anyone. Lol. Even Joe started to annoy me. I hope they won't make another season. It's enough.

But I am still bumped that this it still hasn't gotten a single Emmy nomination. Such great acting, and well written, captivating storylines. Yes I agree that some storylines are very unlikely, but that is no reason for this show to get a diss on a Emmy nomination. I will never be able to rewatch Pen Badgley without thinking of Joe Goldberg. This season has the best acting yet. I hope it continues on, and hopefully a last season will follow Joe's trial and we will see clips of Joe's past even more, cuz he eventually really needs to get caught.

Most of the characters were insufferable and it was hard to sit through.Season 4...what are you even doing anymore???You can really tell that they are running on fumes when it comes to ideas for the storyline.Season 5 will be the last season and thank god for that!

It just got a bit silly. It got a bit repetitive. And to us Brits who live or have lived in London, it just got too far-fetched. The MASSIVE coincidences, the plot holes and the suggestion that the city is more of a village whereby people bump into each other all of the time got tiresome.The factual errors started to get under my skin too - fake Premier League team names, people nipping off to the pub and leaving sawmills open and functional, Joe going to a fro as he pleased to a private club with a £10K membership fee without having to pay etc.I wish it had ended at series three."},{"id":"rw8947560","title":"I find it torturous","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"24 March 2023","text":"I don't know how many more seasons we're going to have to wait for Joe to pay for what he's done, as it becomes torturous for the viewer to almost have to root for things to go well for him after he's committed another heinous crime, only to end up regretting supporting him. Maybe that's one of the ingredients that makes this show a rollercoaster of emotions and thoughts for those who watch it. The dedication of the protagonist is both attractive and scary, and that's another ingredient for liking this show. I thought the fourth season was the best by far. In terms of writing, it's brilliant. The acting of all the actors is brilliant. However, I can't give it a perfect score because I find it torturous that they keep setting us up to tend to be disappointed with Joe, just when it seems like we're going to give him another chance.

Season 3 is up and down. Season 4 is almost ridiculous. The problem with this shows is that it takes the story sideways to extend its natural length. Season one and two are fresh and interesting. From then on, you can almost see the writers scratching out ideas and crossing them out to make the show live on. By season 4, the show is a parody of itself, recycling plot points, going into soap opera territory. Terribly disappointing by the end. It's really hard to stop watching a show after you've invested so much time into it. Naturally, you want to see how it ends.

Joe should have died. He should have ended up in the cage Marianne was in and left there to rot and die, that would have been the appropriate ending to this otherwise amazing show. That was the direction I was hoping it would take when Nadia got the Ketamene. It was also very unrealistic that Joe disassembled and cleaned up the cage all by himself. It was interesting that they gave his split personality a physical manifestation in the last few episodes to visually explain his inner struggles and although it was a bit of a stretch it was acceptable.

Pretty good. But found Season 3 a little tedious, and lost interest about halfway through. Season 4, however, I found much more clever and intriguing. The London location expanded the interest level a bit, as did the characters, social commentary on the 'haves and have nots' as well as what it means to be good versus evil. There were some interesting twists and so I didn't feel that the ending was too obvious. Which I loved. I think the addition of the Kate character, and Charlotte Richie's excellent acting, really pushed the series up a few notches.

However, Season 4, Episode 8 put the final nail in the coffin for me and completely changed Joe's character from what we knew (or thought we knew) through the previous 37 episodes.Never had a show lose all of my interest in one defining episode like this.

First, actors of Kate's friends group are terrible. I hate when a new season of any tv series adds a bunch of cheap mediocre-talented cast to make it refreshing, but it never really works. Second, 'whodunit is the lowest form of literature.' Gosh, I've watched Elite, One of Us Is Lying, and countless other high teen series, figuring out a killer throughtout a season.What we love about 'YOU' is tight and raging storyline and Joe's psychological roller coaster process. The Killer has to be Joe. I was worried that season four gears into different direction but loses original purpose instead. However, it exceeds my expectation. It was easy for me to figure out Rhys is the killer for the first half. I got to admit that I did not see the second big reveal coming. Even though there are many holes in the plot, the pace of the story and the amount of information complement disadvantages.Season 5 will be a greater challenge for writers. Joe is not just average Joe anymore. Audience does not see him as a victim of domestic violence and harsh world after redemption from the public and stepping up to the top of the ladder. Each killing will need more and more effort and justification not to appall audience to the level of them leaving the show completely."},{"id":"rw8937686","title":"Season 4 is terribly boring and ruins the reputation of the previous ones","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"19 March 2023","text":"Season 4 is so terribly boring that it ruins the reputation of the previous ones. First season was great, second good, third okay(ish) but the fourth is so dumb and boring that there are no words. Every episode is a completely unrealistic one full with actions and events that would not at all happen in real life or even the dumbest people would resolve. People don't act so illogically. It really is a pain to watch. With this rapidly falling trend of quality I truly hope there would be no further seasons. An absolute disgrace what they have done with this series.

So many reviewers mention that season 3 or 4 are bad, but I'm on episode 4 of the first season and I think it's pretty bad. I can't even imagine it being worse than what I'm watching.

Season one - absolutely LOVED it. The story; the characters; the acting.Season two was very good as well. For me, not quite up to the first, but still incredibly enjoyable to watch.I feel that I sort of forced my way through season three because at that point I felt pretty committed to the show. I certainly didn't hate it, but it was not even close to season one as far as enjoyability.So then comes season four. I couldn't even make it through the first episode!I'm not saying I expect total believability from a series such as this, but when I saw that Joe was working as a college professor at a UK university, I totally lost it. I mean, really? Wasn't there any other profession they could have chosen for him? The idea that he would be able to get a job at that level is absolutely ridiculous and downright impossible. Impossible.And from what I've read, the writers did it purposefully, which makes it even worse. This is from an article I read while researching to make sure I didn't miss the episode where Joe got his PhD, or even his college degree for that matter:\"It turns out that You author Caroline Kepnes and showrunner Sera Gamble have been hoping to put Joe in this setting for quite some time. \"We've known for years that we wanted to eventually put him in a university,\" Gamble told Entertainment Weekly.\"I get that Joe got himself a new identity for season four, but again, I can literally guarantee that he would not be able to land a job such as this. Even with a brand new identity.It's fiction, so of course they can do what they want, but I think this is just plain dumb. And annoying.I know it probably sounds trivial to some, but it's freaking lazy on the part of the writers. And if that's how lazy they want to be with something so simple, I just don't feel compelled to invest any further time here.It was good while it lasted for me..."},{"id":"rw8930727","title":"Season 4 best","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"15 March 2023","text":"Season 4 to me was the best because of an entirely new twist.

Personally I found Love to be the most nauseating character of the entire series and I was also not a fan of Guinevere Beck. Not that GB was a horrible person, just boring. Love was absolutely horrid.Season 4 had Kate, Marianne & Nadia who were decent people - as was Lady Phoebe. I hope there will be a fifth season.Honestly don't get the bad reviews for season 4.

The main character Joe is someone, who tries to do the right thing and gets himself into impossible situations where in order to survive he has to do the wrong thing. He is driven by universal desires we can relate to - he is just that much more eager to pursue them at all costs, including murder. Joe is daring, bold and resourceful, but most of us would never go to the lengths he goes to, or become as persistent to the point of not being able to give up, aka obsessive. Is he a psychopath? He does show empathy, some remorse and a desire to love and be loved.I noticed where he usually goes wrong is A) he has to help people he has a soft spot for whether they want him to or not - because he has an unacknowledged saviour complex - and from there it snowballs and all his other troubles arise - and B) he has to solve all problems singlehandedly. Nobody else is competent enough or can be trusted to help or advise him. This was especially obvious in season 4 where he wants to catch the eat the rich killer on his own.Some people do not like season 4 because so many of the supporting characters are unlikeable, but I found it very true to life - so many people in real life are unlikeable - and by comparison they make Joe seem more likeable. It ramps up all the fun and games of a classic murder mystery, when one after one they are killed off.I was expecting this to be the last season, so I loved the ending - it is so subversive and goes against what we have come to expect of moralistic storytelling. In real life it is a coin toss whether bad behaviour is punished or rewarded. It reminds me of Woody Allen's \"Match Point\". And yet the ending speaks basic - even cliché - truth to the rest of us non-murderers - that we can find happiness and love when we become whole, when we learn to accept, embrace and love ourselves as we are. Because how can we expect to love and be loved, if we cannot love ourselves."},{"id":"rw8930362","title":"Fight club?","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"15 March 2023","text":"First and foremost, season 3 was the best thus far. Season 4 had a unique flow to it, very new and super engaging, love the fight club twist which was completely unexpected. Leading up to it my mind was scrambling for an answer (Its his twin, yes he must have a twin that looks just like him), Loved the Joe/ Kate dynamic, it felt super authentic and it seemed the writers wanted us to feel that. Like when the relationship was developing in the burning house epi, joe was even reluctant about the love forming. He even turns her down after!! Comes to show that he truly cares for kate and doesnt want to hurt her (Or kill her). Dope season overall, only flaw was that stalker lady, felt a bit forced."},{"id":"rw8929192","title":"Weak and getting weaker","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"15 March 2023","text":"First three seasons were weak but palatable. Fourth season was absolute BS. Totally unbelievable. Absolutely could not have happened. Don't waste any more time. Hopefully this over. Acting was mediocre at best throughout, not now writing has become hack level at best. I guess Greg Kinnear has hit rock bottom to take part in something written at this level. The show needs to be killed before any more characters are killed. Netflix is almost always hit or miss. More misses lately though. Starved for content I know, but needs a better effort than this.

I'm not saying it's my favorite show or even close to that but it's one of the most surprising shows I've seen.

Its something new - finally! Nadia is sometimes not very convincing in my opinion. Besides Nadia I think the new actors are really good. Especially Kate and Rhys really made this season shine.

Who knew \"Dan Humphrey\" as a serial killer would have such power?Three seasons in and the show continues to authentically ramp up the stakes. Joe goes from his first obsession to going bi-coastal with a serial killer wife to now being internationally dangerous.

How can we go from Season 3 Love to Season 4 Kate who for me is absolutely cold character without any interesting features.

Twisting the story so Joe (Jonathan) was the \"You\" was a refreshing change, especially after season 3 and the mystery around who was sending the messages, who knew \"Joe\" was exciting. There were twists and turns and to be honest I think most people watching were wondering who the mystery messenger was in the first part of season 4. Albeit some very annoying characters but all in all a decent start to the new series/recovery from season 3.I didn't see the twist coming and to be honest I wasn't a huge fan. It didn't link up with Joe's character from the previous season, a man very obviously in control of his crimes/feelings/guilt and certainly not a man who would randomly turn mentally insane through hallucinations and multiple identities. Something just didn't sit well and I felt like I was watching a completely new series and not a new series of an existing show.That's being said, I did watch it fairly quickly, episode after episode so it must have done something for my curiosities and kept me entertained.

It's unfortunate, as it was a promising series. Season 4 in particular uses familiar and unbelievable storylines. I can't comprehend why some actors were cast. The character of Kate is particularly annoying and is always wearing clown-like makeup. This season grasps for straws (ratings) and really makes you hate Joe Goldberg, whereas before you kind of used to root for him. It's so unbelievable how he could get away with everything he has done, especially being so skinny and out of shape. At least Dexter was more believable and had a likable leading actor.Needless to say, I won't be watching anymore if it does happen to come back for season 5.

On the other hand, he really is, so why does it surprise me, haha. I think I have to rewatch the beginning of season 4 because I still don't understand how he ended up in that weird circle of rich kids, or better: adults behaving like teenagers.

Basically, that's the major plot of this series. But, S4 showed us more than that. The JOE in this season was morally compromised to the point that he is imagining things beyond reality. It also (somehow) tells us that accepting our innermost faults can set us free. I like the new season but the ending for me isn't as exciting as the previous seasons. Joe needs to be desperate but now he has all the sources he needs to get away with anything and I think that makes it least exciting (well, at least for me)."},{"id":"rw8919117","title":"A fantastic and surprising series","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"11 March 2023","text":"I highly recommend you to see this series, it is really very intriguing and with many twists and turns that never make the story obvious. With the release of the first part of the third season when I first saw it I thought it was a failure, (no longer having the characteristics on which the series is based i.e. A psychopathic man who obsessed over a woman and goes all out for her), as a continuation of the series as in my opinion the second and third seasons were the best, or so I thought. With the release of the second part of the third season it really amazed me how the story is completely changed and made much more interesting and complicated.

All the problems that happen to him are punctually resolved sending often and willingly to hell the suspension of disbelief. This thing makes me boil with rage, because after four seasons of killing women he falls in love with or those who are in the wrong place at the wrong time, seeing that no one competent investigates or asks some questions is unnerving (and excluding those who do not speak out of fear, the few people who know the secret of Joe not only cover him but admire him as well). Obviously there are also serious murders in which the victims are men and the justification of \"they were bad people, I do it to protect my beloved\" I think not even Joe belive himself. Seriously, one who has killed almost all the women he's been with or those who have discovered him, how can he even think of himself as a \"champion of women\" or \"ideal man\" or even just a human being? Did I mention that makes me nervous? It will be that after four seasons of victimization and deresponsibilization, I expected a real breakthrough and instead this character is stuck in a vicious circle that swallows even me spectator. I imagine the writers in the writers room talking about the \"twist\" of the seventh episode...gimmick narrative that I expected from the first minute of the first episode. Why? Certainly not because I'm a genius or something, but because I knew that not even remotely there would be a real threat to Joe and when I stop worrying about the fate of the protagonist (that here is a psychopathic serial killer but is always fictional character) there's a big script problem. In addition, let's say that none of the new characters interest me, I do not care about their dramas, what happens to them, and this leads me to judge the fourth season as the worst. I think I can not give more than a 4/10, despite Penn is very good and in fact I save only him in all 10 episodes. At this point if there will be a fifth season I do not think I will watch it, I was betting a lot on this new season and they were wrong everything they could be wrong. If in a \"who done it\" already immediately I can tell you with certainty who is the killer, then it means that you have to choose a genre in which you can be less banal, because those who at least watch tv series, movies, or read stories of this kind, expects a certain narrative expedient to be used with full knowledge and not only to make exclaim \"OMG I could never have imagined it!\" to those who may have only seen You."},{"id":"rw8917507","title":"I battled with my Alter and Lost.","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"10 March 2023","text":"You- Season 1 is Great.

He's a complete stranger, a lame English professor with no money, connections, social media or noble background. All of the rich people accept him IMMEDIATELY and he's invited to the best parties, shows and clubs, hell even their homes and business meetings!This was written for no other reason than to frame the plot conveniently so Joe can get close enough to investigate a murder. Nothing about this feels real and because of this, all dialogue and contrived relationships seem stale and hollow.What made You seasons 1 through 3 so amazing was the through line of Joe's development and how far he will go to fuel his obsession for a woman. Each season focused on a girl who consumes Joe's entire mind. Joe would risk getting caught A LOT to stalk and carry out all his inappropriate compulsions. An addiction which led him to kill and do horrible things. In Season 4, that entire neurosis goes away as he ignores beautiful women throwing themselves on him in order to follow up on leads and be a hipster Sherlock Holmes.

I am gonna be real: if you like the fact that it makes no possible sense and the fact that they try to explain it to you, then I can say that I thought there were people who cared about what they watched. I guess I should write movies or series that insult the viewer's intelligence and maybe I can get really rich. Or maybe that's what happens when you have 4 main writers and a total of 13 in season 4. How are you going to tell a story if you have 13 different people trying to tell it? I mean it worked in the first 2 seasons but it is just not good after that.

One reviewer here argues that this current season (part one of S4) is just breaking the formula and that's all good because who wants constant repetition?Yeah, no.This season is so divergent from the mission of the series it comes off out of left field entirely. My theory is that this kinda generic Brit-flavored (sorry, Brit-flavoured) script was floating around Hollywood, un-produced for a bit. The show runners of \"You',\" up against a dealine for the new season, grabbed it, thinking they could hammer/shoehorn/twist this Whodunit into a workable series with minor tweaks.Notice how Marienne's catch-up storyline barely rates 20 minutes of screen time? The other \"catch-ups\" are also mighty short and awkwardly worked in.I had this same feeling watching the second and third seasons of \"The Sinner,\" too.Just a theory.

Season 3 was a bit of a disappointment so I wasn't even sure I would watch Season 4 but am glad I did. The writers made a smart move by switching up the format - many mysterious and quirky characters, a bit darker, surprising twists, and a creepy manor house. Joe, now a charming London professor is more likeable. His charisma really carries the show but there is a strong supporting cast. Great chemistry between Joe and Kate. Nice change of scene too with it being set in London and the English countryside.

Almost loved it. I loved the early Dexter meets Mr Rodgers vibe this show put off the first 3 Seasons. But getting to season 4 was a bit of a reach for me. I would have loved to have seen how he escaped America and ended up in England. I think that was a big miss by the writing team. I also liked that the show seemingly changed scenery by ending up in London. The cinematography was fantastic as they really captured London's beautiful sites and cityscapes. This is where it loses me... The writing has a ton of holes in, and I mean a ton. Joe standing outside the building surrounded by police but conveniently and easily snuck past them and investigated the murder scene. There are a ton of scenes like this... Hiding bodies from authorities even though London has one of the biggest CCTV nets in the world. Not to mention the over the top Rich elitist just being more annoying than anything. Like literally zero substance, all while I have a Murderer narrating to the audience on life lessons and values. Stick to your game Netflix, the audience doesn't want to be preached to by a fictional psychopath. But the real kicker for me was when they were pheasant hunting. First off, No one especially the rich use side by side shotguns to hunt pheasants. Nor do they make a pump shotgun sound as they're reloading them. While there are in fact some great directions the show has gone, they seem to have gotten a little lazy when it comes to details.

Although the story hooks you up from the start, I just can't believe the makers let Joe get away with everything he did. Not only is that highly unrealistic but it also does not provide a sense of fairness to viewers. Of course, the show has to continue for seasons, so the main character has to stay in it, but the fact that Joe can kill, drag bodies, fool everyone, and not even a single camera catching him just bogs my mind. What is even the point of portraying a villain like he is and seeing him enjoy it and get away with it?

Just self centered gits who do not live in the real world. Hate them all.Plus, how did Joe ever manage to live in Europe, then rent a huge flat in a posh part of London and become a Literature Professor in a London University'?In England he would need at least a Ph.

BUT, season 4 is dreadful. The characters are weak, Joe has basically become pathetic and the leading role opposite (Karen) is dreadful (although she was good in Ghosts). The plot struggles to settle, with very little cohesion and awkward moments where the writers tried to tie things off in a bow for the hard of thinking. Characters are introduced that are a waste of time, adding no more value than a piece of furniture. Location wise Royal Holloway looks fantastic as ever, but the location is totally wasted as we shift between there, Joe's London flat and the a country retreat - the whole point of Joe's new life as a Uni Lecturer is pointless and only allows Joe to meet Nadia (a rather cliche troubled student character). The final episode in drop 1 of the season is farcical- for instance it sees Joe pushed out of a 2nd floor window, landing on is back in a shallow bush, yet moments later he is up an moving around freely. The pointless basement scene where the 'oh no I never guessed it was them (yawn)' killer has Joe chained up with a character I can't even be bothered to talk about, is boring. Sadly drop 2 looks like Joe's quest to hunt down the real killer (yawn). Only saving grace is that Love Quinn looks to be back (probably only in one scene as Joe hallucinates). Have read some great twist theories online, one where Joe is actually still in the US drugged and held captive by Love and this whole season 4 is a dream (badly acted nightmare) - hoping that is true as the reality of what it actually is could see this rubbish being nothing more than an insult to the first 3 seasons.

This was definitely promising in the first season. The second season was good too. But I was disappointed at the originality. It became so predicable and there were too many unrealistic events. After the first two seasons it gets too repetitive and the main character gets dull. I wanted to give it a real chance but the way most of the characters where painted to be dumb and clueless got to me quick. The main character/ narrator was very interesting to get into his mind but eventually he also fell into the same pit. Giving this and 8/10 is pretty generous and perhaps a bit premature. I am reviewing this after watching all of it and not saying not to watch it at all but I want to bring the expectation to normal levels. I did not read the book this show is based off off but I would but my uneducated guess would be it became a best seller from the story of the first season only. Perhaps the tv adaptation thought the main character and story was able to captivate audiences for a prolonged time.

Joe wraps the body in a a tarp and dumps it into the trunk of his car, where, instead of disposing of it immediately, he goes to help Beck assemble a new bed, leaving a rotting corpse in the trunk of his car while it sits parked on the street.

In the end of s3 he escaped with nothing. Fact: the average British house is 6-8 STEPS wide. Like if u walk in front of a house, from side to side is 6-8 steps. Watch tv interviews with people in their homes if you don't believe me. Maybe after 70 years working as a professor he could afford to live in a place like that. And it doesn't exist in England.And the weather is gray and miserable 80% of the time, yet in this show's universe it's magically sunny every day. Ffs make an effort. What's the point of this fake reality? So bored Americans can get a glimpse of a fake British \"classy\"? Not to mention that most authentic British accents sound like barn raised animals, like Boris Johnson for example. There is a classy British accent that I personally know a lot of British people learn to fake to sound \"posh\". Lame as it is, but the ones on s4 here are sooooooo fake it's painful to hear. Someone told these awful actors to extend their lower jaw to sound British. 😅 and they did. So it's not only painful to hear it's even worse to see how they tried and failed miserably. The only person in the show with an inkling of talent is Kate. Why did she accept to act with these TikTok \"celebrities\" is beyond my comprehension.I am considering switching to a foreign dubbed language and using subtitles, that is if I still want to watch the show, I am halfway thru ep1 and couldn't hold back on warning poor potential viewers of the ear torture they're about to be subjected to, it's very clear that only the outside scenes were shot in England while the rest is in studios somewhere in the us were real British actors weren't available for low pay or something so they opted for fake British \"posh\" accents since most Americans think British people are classy, just for no other reasons than Americans just being less classy that's all. They think British people are well educated coz they \"read a lot\" and use bookmarks. Again reading less than enough doesn't make the ones that read a little bit more actually well educated. The ignorance is as common here as it is anywhere. Reading novels and watching reality tv doesn't make people smart. So, what was the point of this whole British saga? None whatsoever."},{"id":"rw8870984","title":"This: edit after finishing","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"14 February 2023","text":"Is for season 4 so far. I rated it higher than I'd like as not to bring the overall review for the show itself down! I loved season 1! I watched it on Lifetime before Netflix bought the rights. Season 2 was good, 3 ok this was when \"You\" became anyone and now in season 4 its like a British who dun it without even the need for Joe! Am I not correct that they could have used anyone and achieved the same! YOU is well about YOU! Joes obsession to possess whoever YOU is body and soul! Now also the YOU are just out of place with whom Joe goes for. Like SPOILERS Charlotte Ritchie as a possible YOU?!? Gone is where he sees a woman and he obsesses and tries to figure out every little thing about her whilst stalking her. That's what YOU was about! Now were led to believe that the unattractive ( sorry but true) Charlotte Richie is that one?!? Also it would be a lot more interesting if this someone ( he's calling you) that seems to know about his past was someone from the days of Beck or Love. I still don't think it's this senator. Or shall I say I know he isn't the one the call the \"eat the rich killer\"? He had him chained and wanted to see him kill. Any ways they've strayed so fat form what made \"you\" what it is. It's basically now a stupid UK rich kid murder mystery with the worst characters one could dream up! Lets hope there's a twist and someone is alive from the days of Beck or Love and it becomes interesting! After reading a few new reviews I wanted to edit to add!!!This is nothing like Dexter morons! Dexter was a sociopath that had a hard time loving or expressing love! Where as Joe is obsessed with it and the idea and murders for LOVE! Dexter murdered because he had the urge and his father taught him how to control it and if he had t kill to kill serial killers etc who deserved it! Thar is the opposite of YOU and it's premise etc. Good god! Millenials are more ignorant than I thought! OK Wanted to add it may have made for a ok season ( since he found Marianne) if they had expounded on that instead of the monstrosity it's become but we shall see... I'm editing after finishing the entire series and as someone whose watched all the seasons( since 1 was on Lifetime) I must say I'm extremely disappointed! This was made to appeal to Millenials?! It was awful! So Yes the MO of Joe with Mirrienne would have been fine of that was the entire premise! So were led to believe he hit his head and forgets a few weeks?? Someone so broken dreams up a false reality but everything else is real?!? His relationship with Charlotte Richie was ridiculous! And Greg Kinnear waa awful! Did he forget how to act as we are to supposedly forget JOE and all the previous seasons! Come on. Charlotte Richie( and I liked her in Freah meat but this is unforgivable! Horrible season!"},{"id":"rw8870970","title":"Amazing!","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"14 February 2023","text":"\"You\" is an interesting TV show, it keeps you engaged and wondering about the rest of the characters.

I do like serial killer shows, I did like this show as its almost comical how he gets away with murder and the way he goes on about it. The protagonist represents a good reflection of the craze of a serial killer and lapses in reasoning. It is a fiction regardless. During the previous seasons the characters had depths to them, there was variety and a good balance of content, characteristic to the YOU series. Season 4 overdone parts they shouldn't had to, and underdone parts they should had to keep or improve on. The characters are dumb, all of them, there is noone to root for anymore, the acting is subpar- it almost feels like it was a conscious choice to recruit bad actors for this season. Just bad overacting all over the place. This season takes place in London, but it feels like whoever set up the script and the storyline had been to England once or did an hour Google search on London. Also, as the season progressing, not long into it, I felt like its a cheap knock off of an Agatha Christie novel... and it is, probably 5mins after it gets confirmed \"a whodoneit, the lowest form of literature\". Well, it was. It became a series with elements that you have seen a thousand times, but this time it feels like its done on an amateurish way because they tried to implement this whodoneit method into something that doesn't fit this schedule. It was an entertaining show, and it became a huge disappointment. I watched all 5 episodes, hoping sometime it gets better, and it didn't really. The other thing, the ending of episode 5 when Joe gets determined to do something at the end, assuming the content of the next 5 episodes. I won't make a spoiler on this. What the hell was that? Its so out of character for Joe, its so ridiculous that even in a show like this its just laughable on a really bad away. Who came up with this, they called season 4.... A major disappointment. The shows rewatch potential was big, this not got nulled, but went into minus. With an ending like this, there is no point investing time into it. I will wait for the reviews once the next 5 episodes come out rather than suffer through 5 episodes again, and if not much changes will just give it a rest. But again, I'm not sure there is any point bringing out the next 5 episodes at this point. They carved the tombstone and in a matter of moments this series is lowered well into the grave, simply there is nothing they can do to bring it back at this point."},{"id":"rw8870280","title":"Victoria Pedretti much more interesting actor than Penn Badgley.","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"14 February 2023","text":"Though the idea itself was stolen from Dexter, the execution wasn't too bad until one / third into the season three when the main character became one dimensional and the most interesting character of the show - Love Quinn by Victoria Pedretti got killed off at the end of rapidly degrading third season. It was the last season I will watch. It lost its' drive, speed and intelligence. The main character lacks complexity. Person who easily stops fighting for his family and willingly undermines it in the third season can't be rooted for. Giving a child away and simplifying actions is just a a lazy writing. I would happily started watching the TV show about Love Quinn instead of \"You\", as I think Victoria Pedretti is much more interesting and colourful actor than Penn Badgley."},{"id":"rw8870165","title":"Just a guy that easily gets away with murder.","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"14 February 2023","text":"Imagine getting away with murder all the time and all you have to do is grow a beard for the next season to get away with it.I bet after this next season he'll shave his beard and no one will ever recognize him.Acting is not bad but I can't understand anyone liking Joe enough to really want to continue watching the show. Obviously, the show is a success so I'm proven wrong on this point but where is the thrill in him potentially getting caught when you know he can easily conjure up some half-backed plan to get away without any repercussions.For this reason, I won't watch the show, but I will watch the last episode in hopes Joe finally gets caught."},{"id":"rw8869588","title":"Season 2 onward","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"13 February 2023","text":"This was a great show in season 1.

She only has 2 facial expressions, and they're both extreme.She's the opposite of Penn Badgley who has a broad range from everyday guy to raging lunatic that makes the show work. Victoria always looks and sounds crazy even when she's suppose to be normal.She truly ruins the show, it's not her fault, simply a terrible casting choice. Just like it would be equally disastrous to cast Samuel L Jackson to play a Denzel Washington part.If she's not killed off relatively soon I won't finish the series and have already stopped recommending it like I did to anyone who would listen back when it was originally a Lifetime series."},{"id":"rw8869208","title":"By Far The Most Ridiculous Waste of Money","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"13 February 2023","text":"This is obviously a generational matter to be considered.This is neither funny nor entertaining.The acting is stale, the scripts demented, the entire premise is exhausting by the end of episode one season one.Who pays for these pieces of unadulterated bad taste, senseless scripts, bad acting, bad directing, horrible dialogues, and the once again going into the Darkness of Man's Mind.....How much money did this cost to produce?Who would finance this? And the bigger question is why?Netflix seems to love to through money around just for the sheer joy of seeing if they can 'net' a winner. How do they recoup their financial investment - by researching statistics and demographics and looking for just the right combination to seduce a group of young people who obviously are poorly educated, have no sense of culture nor do they care.Shamefully wasting money for nothing - it will be long forgotten with all too many Netflix original series and films..."},{"id":"rw8869166","title":"A 10/10 TV show","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"13 February 2023","text":"I love the plot twist.

I can say I actually lost my excitement after the first two episodes. The show didn't stick the landing this time around and it's because of the new setting and the way they decided to go this time around. It takes inspiration from all kinds of murder mysteries like \"glass onion\" which was just released on Netflix and portraits it in a badder boring lower budget way. I didn't feel to care for characters or who the killer was, nor did I invest into the whole story. It's a sad 4th season for a fun show. It rarely connects to the previous seasons, kind of plays down the explosive topics and turns of the previous season in a very boring way, without any consequences and just continues like the last 3 seasons didn't really affect the character or his life, other than him not wanting to be that way anymore. It's just handled and written poorly and non suspenseful and this show had so many cool ways to go but safely picked the most boring one.

TikTok is already full of You for marketing. Thats ok if you want to target Gen Z to watch You. But; when I started to watch he already mentioned Gen Z 3 times. Just to be funny or target this audience. I just feels so off and weird. Like, Netflix wants to keep our subscribtion or something through You, because they are making their subsctribtion more strict. It feels really out of character for Joe to mention Gen Z so many times.

Joe isn't as vile, the side characters aren't as interesting, and I find it hard to care about anything in this season. The characters are either fine, or stupidly cartoonish, and Joe's characterization has been watered down.He has a new love interest this season, and it's so unclear why he even likes her in the first place. While he tries to solve the mystery he makes conclusions (more like assumptions) that come out of nowhere and are clearly slapped in for the sake of moving the plot along, whether or not they actually make any sense.Who is Joe? I'm not sure I know anymore. He supposedly has a distain for anti-intellectual modern culture, but he seems to know just as much about it as the average person. He's not out of touch at all like I would expect him to be. His only friends are a bunch of classist socialites who he doesn't even like, or even talk to often it seems, and yet he seems to be a member of their friend group rather quickly even though hardly any of them like him. Why he hangs around in the first place is established far too late. I could be misremembering, but that's what I think.Characters explain their backstories and motivations in long winded exposition dumps that are done with virtually zero finesse, and are oftentimes just straight boring.I still liked it, I guess. I really like the show and I like Joe. Without Joe there'd be no reason for me to watch really. But If you're looking for good writing, stay away from season four :(.

Overall, the character development fell flat. There wasn't one person I was rooting for, except for maybe the abused boy next door. I saw reviewers say it was \"amazing\" how the writers could get the audience to support the likes of psycho Joe. I may have fell into that trap, but it's more likely because I found Beck so off-putting I wanted to see her bloody demise. Exacerbating this blood- thirst of mine was the fact they had Joe leave the more genuine Karen for the likes of her. It felt like maybe the casting directors were tone deaf to the racist overtones this gave off. Our milquetoast heroine lies, cheats, has sexual affairs in front of big windows whilst making her way in an expensive city writing bad poetry. Maybe Beck's character in the book had more substance, but the actress who played Beck made her annoying as f-. Something about the infantile breathless voice, or maybe the minimal use of expressions that veered on the cross- eyed kept me from connecting, as it was so terribly distracting. Further reason why I love literature over film, as bad casting can kill. Badley's acting was far and away superior; he's certainly convincing as the psychotic lead. Yet, I wasn't able to see his appeal either. I'm guessing the attraction to him is why some ppl stick with this. But for me, this made-for-TV series (I.e. Middling piece of crap) just became something to put on in the background while I was vacuuming."},{"id":"rw8866177","title":"Shark has been jumped","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"11 February 2023","text":"So YOU has returned for season 4 and aggressively decided to the jump the proverbial shark and every type of aquatic life that resides in the Atlantic ocean all the way to merry old England.

The story was nonsensical, the acting atrocious and like Joe we were all hoping a bomb would be dropped to put an end to these horribly unlikable characters who make an episode of flavor of love look like classic cinema. I feel like with so many shows it starts with a great idea and then ends with a flaming bag of poop on the doorstep of the writers room when they dont know where to go with it. So few shows need more than 3 seasons. Season 3 was incredible and could have put a fitting end to the Joe Goldberg story.

Watching the first / second season of You filled you with a sort of dread and excitement as to what would happen next but now , I just wait for the boring dialogue to finish as fast as possible.The \"whodunit\" in itself is also entirely uninteresting ; no effort went into placing any clues around to intrigue the viewer or any sort of brainstorm as to what the motives and obsessions the \"Eat The Rich\" killer might have.It seems as if Netflix had their boot down the production of \"You\" and what emerged as of Season 4 was an unfinished , uninteresting and wholly boring season which seemed rushed with very unrealistic scenarios and characters that you could literally not give a care about. I didn't hate any of the characters and I didn't love them and when they eventually got murdered , the most I could muster up was a \"hmm\".This is just the review for Part 1 of Season 4 but this show would need a miracle to become anything more than what it actually is ; a time killer with sex scenes sprinkled in between."},{"id":"rw8865764","title":"Having a hard time to finish the first part season 4","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"11 February 2023","text":"Penn does a great performance as always, a joy to watch him.

It all just seems a bit hasty and therefor unbelievable for me. It just didn't has that same wow factor it had the first three seasons. Also the first seasons were more relationship focused and they took the time to develop it, this time it's more rushed and flat, also lacking a little in the intimacy scenes and I find it hard to believe something is there when everything is more platonic and flat. Really had to push myself to watch trough the end of episode 5 that maybe it reveals something to keep me watching, but no there wasn't a big cliffhanger and I do not care for any of the characters so I'll just keep the first 3 seasons in mind and leave it at that."},{"id":"rw8865404","title":"Struggling through season 4","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"11 February 2023","text":"Seasons one and two were an 8.

The whole dynamics and pace of the show has changed in this season. Instead of being about a serial killer, the serial killer has become an armchair detective, trying to figure out who is trying to frame him for a murder, and also knows about his past.

She was getting very annoying by season 3. Getting married and having a baby did not add to the story at all. I just saw that a season four will be coming out next week. I will probably pass on that."},{"id":"rw8837626","title":"Too messed up for me to think it's edgy cool. No one to root for.

I'm not a 50 year old mom. I'm a younger male. This show is just too sick for me to rate it high.

It just doesn't sit right with me. World's is already hard enough. I don't need to see anything like this on top of it. It's not going to make you go out and repeat his acts.

He naturally exudes an oddly inviting/charismatic aura, which fits the stereotypical 'charming murderer' image. The way he expresses the character's spikes of emotions is also impressive. The beauty hides behind the subtle details, like his facial veins popping when he's angry, or the usually dark and cold look in his eyes slowly morphing into a pitiful juvenile one when he's sad.Next, the storyline is very easy to follow (dare I say addictive), as it is filled with the kind of suspense that makes your palms sweat, coupled with a few unexpected twists. The most surprising one involves Love Quinn, one of the female leads, interpreted by the brilliant actress, Victoria Pedretti. There is a reason why the spectators fell in love with her character : the way the actress utilizes every muscle of her facial features to display a certain kind of emotion is frankly inimitable. In contrast to Guinevere Beck, Goldberg's first love interest, Quinn doesn't look like every basic white girl with a bland and forgettable face : her big downturned eyes, and her large animated lips make her unique and hauntingly charismatic.Finally, the show successfully pushes us to question things about our morals or, in other words, our definition of good and evil. Although the main character is deeply flawed and even dangerous to his surroundings, there is something about him that is undeniably relatable : his strong desire for unconditional love, rooted in his heartbreaking childhood trauma. Throughout the story, a side of my conscience couldn't help but feel empathy for Goldberg. One of the first things that's established in the series is that the stalking-murdering male lead isn't an actual cold-hearted psychopath : he's conscious, he cares, and he feels (sometimes even more than the average human-being). There is always a reason, valid or not, for every one of his actions. Should his parental figures (mainly his mother and the old librarian) be held responsible for the way he turned out to be ? Contrarily, is he inherently bad, in such a way that nobody could have prevented ? Lastly, is Joe Goldberg deserving of forgiveness or, more importantly, of love ? Everybody has their own answers. I truly love when films and shows engage the audience in this manner, by encouraging them to dive into a bubble of philosophical reflection."},{"id":"rw8816945","title":"Love rulls","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"22 January 2023","text":"Second season for me was the best.

Season 3 isn't bad too, but some staffs just didn't have any sense, finale was very dissapointing and in the last episodes it really started to wosing it's grip. I really hope to bring Love in season 4.... I like Joe too, but I really think with Love(together or against each other) they have better screen presense.

Sometimes you will be happy about the events and sometimes you will be sad, but don't worry because life is not possible without challenges. Think about it! Life from the perspective of this series...The main character is hard to relate to at times but understandably so, Love's acting is terrible and the whole plot is simply incredible.This series is not narrated from the third person perspective because the way the show is changed by Joe's thoughts is what keeps it so raw and makes the show not boring; But since we are in the role of a serial killer, we are interested in it.Good and bad, enjoy watching."},{"id":"rw8799452","title":"Sordid, intriguing, deadly","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"14 January 2023","text":"This is a very gripping TV show about stalker Joe Goldberg and his obsessions. Namely women who he thinks is 'The One'.It takes a very clear look into the obsession of the chase, the build up to getting the girl and the consequences of what happens after and the realities of what's left after you get your 'true love'. All mixed in with a level of social media stalking, anger, and stabbings this brings about a sordid tale of when love goes too far and a man overcoming certain 'issues' relating to his upbringing.Also brilliant how they kept making more seasons of this with various women and how each one become a problem to solve into the eventual episode where Joe meets his match and then we see what two crazed, very murderous people do when they are together when their behaviours lead to them acting out more?"},{"id":"rw8773482","title":"Believe this is for real","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"2 January 2023","text":"All seasons are great. The acting , the music, the NY and LA views, the story - all make me believe it based on true story. Penn is creepy and natural the same time. Victoria is so organic in her hysterical behavior. Elizabeth , Shay (Peach) and others - all fulfilled their roles perfectly. Can rewatch this show and never bored. From the season 1 most of all I appreciate the music and the story behind Joe, Beck and Peach. There is no blank holes in the script. From the season 2 I like how the cat-mouse game turning upside down and all plaid naturally. The season 3 is exaggerate the tension, creepiness and anxiety and I am looking forward to see the season 4 soon."},{"id":"rw8756116","title":"offbeat, unpredictable, and very entertaining.","starRating":"9/10","datePosted":"25 December 2022","text":"' You ' is edgy, the story flows like a train wreck in slow motion, that is metered out calmly by the main character, Joe, telling himself and you the viewer, that he is one step away from being the good guy. Only Joe is not and never will be the good guy.Penn Badgley is so smooth, perfect for the role of Joe, who is an unhinged serial killer who fixates on the woman that ultimately become his victims, well them, and just about everyone else that relates to them. Joe has a troubled past, a battered mother, and the father he killed for it. Joe learned to love Books from a deranged foster father, who sealed the deal for Joe the serial killer.You never really root for the killer in this show, but you find yourself intrigued watching Joe apply his twisted logic to everything he does, every horrendous act of violence he enacts. 'You' is offbeat, unpredictable, and very entertaining."},{"id":"rw8747518","title":"Watch Dexter instead.","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"20 December 2022","text":"Not that I'm comparing the series with Dexter, it's pretty vain itself.Our uncharismatic, unsympathetic killer Joe and the screenwriters will continue to lower your IQ in every episode. Joe will obstinately stick out like a sore thumb in front of the Beck's window every episode, will be able to walk around someone's house as if he's in a video game, and all the iq-lowering stuff.My expectations from this series was not that the main character surprises us with his great intelligence or makes superhuman plans, I just wanted to be able to watch it without leaving my brain aside, but with every episode I became more and more sure that the concept of logic was not in this series. Now I will go and watch some sensible series like True Detective or Mindhunter."},{"id":"rw8743988","title":"Terrible 3rd season","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"18 December 2022","text":"First two seasons were good. It was nice to find a show with hardly any PC crap involved. It was a decent show with a quirky, messed up premise that was addictive and served as a fun bit of escapism. Then season three happens...It was as if different writers took over for season 3 (maybe they did, I haven't checked?). It became super PC and really bland and dragged out: no excitement going on, no likeable characters - just a big pile of manure basically.They really should have thought of the phrase \"quality not quantity\" before they decided on another season.My advice? Watch the first two seasons and then stop."},{"id":"rw8729570","title":"Exploring the Dark Side of Obsession","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"11 December 2022","text":"One of the most interesting aspects of the show is the way it explores the dark side of human nature and the lengths that people will go to in order to get what they want. Joe's actions are morally reprehensible, but at the same time, the show does a good job of showing how he rationalizes his behavior and justifies it to himself. We see how his obsession with Beck consumes him and how he becomes more and more detached from reality as he tries to hold onto her at any cost.Another interesting aspect of the show is the way it explores the role of social media and technology in our lives. Joe uses technology as a tool to stalk Beck and control her, but at the same time, we see how it also gives her a sense of power and agency. She uses social media to promote her writing and connect with her audience, and this helps her to gain a sense of independence and control over her own life.Overall, You is a thought-provoking and intense television series that explores the dark side of human nature and the consequences of obsession. It is a must-watch for fans of psychological thrillers and anyone who is interested in the intersection of technology and human behavior."},{"id":"rw8687915","title":"LOVE IT!!!","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"21 November 2022","text":"I love crime and psycho genres and this is really the best one series I ever watched.Can't wait season 4!!!Love it so much.I love the actor who plays Joe and I don't think anyone else could play that role better than him.My thoughts about Love is like she is more psycho than Joe and I pray it for Joe to survive and I'm glad that he did, but I wished he had another way to get away from her and not this way.But what so ever he is alive and that is important.Love him so much even if he is a psychopath.I hope he will find someone he will love and who will love him back.Really can't wait to watch season 4!!!"},{"id":"rw8675609","title":"Classic Curse of More","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"15 November 2022","text":"This is another show that is cursed with success. After it's a hit, the studio wants more. Netflix wants more. Because We supposedly want more. But when you produce more you can't go backward, you have to constantly increase the ante. It has to have more action, more sex, more violence, more characters, more embedded messaging. With all of this, it lost what made it great in the first place.The show's greatest strength, even in the infamous third season, is the dramatic irony. Knowing, or guessing, who knows what others don't, leaving audiences wondering who is bluffing and who has the upper hand.Its main weakness is trying to get audiences to sympathise with its main character. Again they are cursed with success - they do it so well that you get the feeling the writers came to and realize they have to undo what they just did, and it feels rushed and forced.TL;DR, stop after Season 2."},{"id":"rw8652178","title":"Episode 10 / Season 3/ The Worst ever","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"3 November 2022","text":"I believe that the last episode was the worst scenario I have seen before,,,Although there was a good plot and good dialogue in all episodes of the season, the last episode is completely far from the rest of the episodes and I think that the end is stupid and does not contain professional work at all. The director was unable to gather his ideas and did not make an effort to end the season in an interesting way so that the viewers eagerly awaited the next season. Unfortunately, the last episode was trite, as if the director tried to end the season in a provocative way, thinking that it would attract the viewers for the next season, and I do not think that the next season will meet any success.I strongly advise viewers who have a cinematic sense and have never seen the third season, not to waste their time watching it, because the season is full of contradictions and there is no literature on dramatic works and does not respect the minds of viewers, especially American families that maintain morals, as the season does not carry the simplest standards of respect for the social fabric and the family unit that is a cell Building high-end societies, as there are no guidelines and no respect for the minds of viewers,, I finally regretted watching the third season because of the last episode., In addition, there is a mixture of overlapping and conflicting feelings in justifying the killing of the husband actor compared to his wife, who tried with all her efforts and capabilities to preserve her family and her husband."},{"id":"rw8650648","title":"Can't stand shows like this.","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"2 November 2022","text":"My wife and I tried watching a few episodes but we just can't get into it. The concept and setup is great and there are a ton of directions that they can take it.One of the biggest issue here is being over-reliant on shock value. Shock value needs a strong motive for it to work. Without it everything feels fake and forced and random.The biggest issue with the whole series overall, something many movies and shows rely, the excessive attempt at dumbing down everyone in the world to make the story work or to make the protagonist, or antagonist if you prefer, be perceived as a genius.Some form of dumbing down of characters is required because it's a movie but we're talking extremes here.The main guy in this show can literally stroll out in public, stab someone in the face, drag his body a mile, cut it up and dispose of it and no one will have seen, smell, or heard anything. No evidence. No dogs. Cameras pick up nothing.

I know it's supposed to be entertainment but seriously, is this where we are? Glorifying serial killer stalkers of women? While trying to make it funny? At least with Dexter he was actually killing people who did heinous things and deserved to die. I find this in poor taste.

It's hard to know where to start, the premise is great and should open up huge possibilities from twists and turns, and create tension.The whole series is meanders along at a snail pace. There are no surprises and the acting is adequate at best. So much is unbelievable that I would get annoyed. Right from the word go Joe who is obsessed with Beck openly stands in the middle of the road watching her in broad daylight, while she is in a huge open window going about her business yet never sees him out there. Really? Never mind that it is very convenient that she is the only person in NY who has a huge window on to the street without anything for privacy.

Badgley makes Joe seem Sinister and imperfect, which is exactly what makes the show so intriguing.The way the show alters by Joe's thoughts is what keeps it so raw, if it was narrated from a third person perspective, I think the show would be boring but since we are in the eyes of a serial killer, we gain interest in it.The show also has the correct amount of violence and narration. Action isn't always occurring, which is perfect due to suspense being key in a thriller like this.The writing is also formed in a way which makes you sometimes side with Joe, which is why Joe is such an important and interesting character.The show isn't perfect though, there's a lot of \"cheesy\" aspects to the show which make it seem unrealistic despite realism being the intention.The directors make Joe seem like the sane one throughout the seasons, which especially with his role, is not what should happen.A lot of the cast don't get as much air time as they deserve, which is a bummer since many of them are talented actors."},{"id":"rw8423946","title":"Stop at season 1","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"11 August 2022","text":"As a wannabe Dexter season 1 gets 7/10th the way there, but season 2 seams to have been written by a couple of teenagers that have absolutely no concept of reality or believability.

Quite a rollercoaster of great acting here.All 3 seasons delivered, with enough twists and last episode chaotic situations, that left me thinking \"how the hell he's he going to come out of this\" on the last episodes.I was very sceptic at first, specially due to some avoidable and quite dumb out of place pseudo-erotic mb scenes, but I kept the faith and was not disappointed.Strong points: the twists, chaotic situations, unpredictable moves and pace, all with wonderful acting through and through.Weaker points: imbecile erotic out of place moments (thankfully not many), terrible soundtrack that does not amaze or stay in the head (sorry) and dumb moves from Joe (and not only): not using gloves, using the same hat to hide himself (ala Clark Kent with his eyeglasses) and less attention to detail when we know he could be caught by doing the same mistakes over and over again.But... it's a great series nonetheless. If you loved \"Dexter\", it's not on par, but delivers, in a more \"modern\", less careful way and sometimes even a bit more chaotic in the situations where Joe puts himself on.Season 1 great, Season 2 good, Season 3 great again (don't understand the hate, really)."},{"id":"rw8286172","title":"good","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"29 June 2022","text":"SS.1 7/10😱😍👹\nSS.2 8/10😯😯\nSS.3 6/10😐\nPart 1 The movie came out well.

Having become a fan and watched a few movies with her I gave it a shot. Season 1 was painful to sit through. Season 2 got better with her and my netflix queen Victoria Pedretti who i loved in hill house and bly manor and i was invested. Season 3... happend. So now i can only wait for Jenna's return and hope to end the shows protagonist who is absolutely uncomfortable and i just do not like this show.

I think it was all the memes and fancams on Instagram that actually kept me from wanting to check it out but my wife convinced me finally sit and watch a few episodes and I really fell in love with the show. Sort of has a \"dexter\"vibe if you like that kind of thing. That becomes especially prevalent as the seasons go on.So if your looking for a suspense that's got some comedy, mystery and sex then this might be for you."},{"id":"rw8182906","title":"Well acted and interesting, but the character is very hard to like","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"28 May 2022","text":"There have been a lot of comparisons to \"Dexter,\" and it's obvious why: both characters are murderous psychopaths with whom we're supposed to at least somewhat sympathize because they're doing objective good. The big difference between them, however, is that Dexter understands that he's a psychopath and Joe doesn't. That is, Dexter is \"I'm crazy but I'll work hard at channeling it in a positive direction,\" while Joe is \"I'm completely sane and this is just what perfect boyfriends do.\" For me, that made Dexter a lot easier to connect with than Joe. Beck's big rant at the end of Season One (which is all I've watched) completely summed up my feelings about Joe; I can't love him, or even like him, for exactly the same reasons Beck couldn't. I quite like anti-heroes -- I'm a huge fan of the Flashman novels, for example -- but there has to be at least a little bit of \"hero\" to balance out the \"anti,\" and I'm not seeing it with Joe. I just basically hate the guy. I'd imagine that one reason I'm supposed to sympathize with him is that he's very good-looking, which he certainly is, but that's not helping in my case.That said, the writing is terrific -- I suspect that the author of the novels put in a fair amount of time in an MFA program, and it shows -- and the acting is stellar all around. Particular kudos to Elizabeth Lail, who really pulls off a complex character who could have been just your average TV blonde-hottie cartoon character, and to Luca Padovan, who does this sort of thing a whole lot better than most kid actors. I may give Season 2 a shot, but it's on probation and I'm keeping a very close eye out for shark-jumping.(And speaking of the Flashman novels, it absolutely boggles my mind that nobody's done a TV adaptation. They're PERFECT. There's been one movie, \"Royal Flash\" back in 1975, and it was wonderful, but nothing since then. Hey Netflix, it appears that you like charming anti-heroes; how 'bout it?)"},{"id":"rw8174243","title":"ONE OF THE BEST THRILLERS IN THE SERIES","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"25 May 2022","text":"THIS SERIES IS PRETTY MUCH GREAT, YOU'LL DEFENITELY GO WITH THE THINKING OF JOE, AND THE STORY LINE OF THIS SERIES IS JUST SO BRILLIANT WITH LOTS OF ROMANCE AND THRILL THAT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND."},{"id":"rw8162141","title":"A good thriller watch!","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"21 May 2022","text":"What's Good-\nIt may give a guilt of viewing something that romanticises horrible crimes towards women: stalking, violence and even murder.Yet 'You' captures attention of its audience, and gives not only entertaining thrill ride but also writes it characters and plot in such an amazing and intelligent way.A good thriller watch!"},{"id":"rw8129859","title":"It's One Thing...","starRating":"2/10","datePosted":"9 May 2022","text":"... to have ONE season of a series where the \"hero\" is a psychopathic muderer, but quite another to have three. There are plot holes here, to be sure, but the main problem is that ten hours of this creep is more than enough. I kept hoping he'd get caught, but he didn't, and he even kills the main \"woman in jeopardy,\" which violates one of the cardinal rules of filmmaking. (Ask Alfred Hitchcock.) Even after he does away with Beck -- who, bottom line, is a sympathetic character -- I was still OK with the ending of season one. I get it -- he's still out there, so be scared.

The two are psychopaths and would do anything to stay together including murder, from the previous season the female lead character -Love - reveals her other side which is similar to the male lead (Joe). I expected in this season the two characters would live a happy life without killing anyone in the new town the moved to . The plot was really interesting with a good twist especially in the last episodes. One may think they know exactly where Joe and Love's relationship is heading but the event turns transforming the story into something that feels almost unrecognizable. Love attempts to kill Joe as he is in love with another woman but surprisingly Joe had already anticipated it and was able to save himself with an antidote he made. In a premeditated murder , he kills Love , cut this toe nails to leave as DNA and disappeared leaving everyone to think Love committed the homicide. The season is amazing and keeps one on their feet just like the previous two seasons.

I'm probably one of the few out there, but I liked Joe and Love together as a couple (their characters had great, immersive chemistry no matter how toxic their love was). And, sadly the hack writers of Season 3 had to obliterate their relationship and have him chase after the librarian, Marienne.Furthermore, please do yourself a favor and don't waste your time watching catastrophic Season 3.

I was wrong. The thing that surprised me the most was how much humor is in it. It made me laugh a life more than I expected. Now, people saying that this isn't as good as Dexter are absolutely right (not much is), it isn't, but it definitely holds up on its own and thought it was overall a pretty good show. Penn Badgley does a fantastic job as the lead and Elizabeth Lail and Victoria Pedretti are both great in their roles as well. Now that I started it I can't wait for more seasons to come!"}]
