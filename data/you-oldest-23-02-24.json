The actors are faithful in portraying the charecters. Pen Bagely as Joe (maybe I mispelles his name lol) but he does a great job.

It's uncomfortable and unpredictable and has what is hopefully an amazing story to tell from a unique perspective.We're put into the head of a stalker who seems to be a hair's width away from violence. The tension is held well.But what REALLY made it feel uncomfortable for me was a rather odd choice from the network. Swearing is censored out. There are these conspicuous blanks in the dialogue. It had me obsessing. When you've got a show this dark, who the hell do they think they're going to offend with a little swearing? Are they expecting kids to be up watching it? It's content is far more offensive than swearing could ever be.Apart from that one VERY annoying point, it's a brilliantly put together show.

Badgley is pitch perfect to the character In the book, down to his internal, one-sided conversations with Beck, which was one of the best parts of the book (IMO).

So....This show happened to come on after a lifetime movie I was watching had went off. I was going to change the channel but decided to let the show play. I ended up not being able to turn the channel. I decided to watch the entire season. Very entertaining, creepy, and intriguing. Penn Badgley is amazing as Joe. He is a character you love to hate and hate to love. A modern, creepy twist on a love story. Stellar cast and great acting.

I suggest Listening to the audio book for a true immersive experience. Santino Fantino is 100% JOE - he plays the character SO well. It is worth listening to the book vs reading it. Either way. You should listen or read the book before watching this show. You will be better equipped to know what is going on.I don't know where to start. When hearing about the film / tv Adaptation of the book, I was extremely excited. Then, I saw the trailer. Wow. Talk about what the heck moment. There were guns, characters looked nothing like they were described in the book (peach). I decided to reserve my doubts and opinions until the show came out.Well, now that the show is out. I am completely appalled that caroline kepnes signed off on this. They have added non-essential characters that weren't in the book, the timeline is all-over-the place and the events are happening way too quickly to really understand the gravity of Joe's nature. They are making references that didn't even happen in the show (but did int he book) (like the drunkard singing engine no.9 in the train station) - Joe and beck talk about it in the book... not in the show..- Joe doesn't reveal himself to beck then, either. Joe tries to lure benji into the cage way too early in the show and beck gives Joe a book with engine no.9 inscribed.. even though they didn't talk about it in the show! Wtf? I really don't know how they can make 2 seasons out of this if they are already this far into the story in the freaking pilot!I feel like this is The Stand all over again. Character roles have been changesd drastically, some may have been omitted and they do not match remotely anything close to what the book describes. I see it as an insult to us devoted readers whom have supported this book from the beginning. It is extremely sad to see it butchered the way is has been. So many people are coming into this story without reading the book and they are being misled. Watching the pilot I was constantly saying to myself, WHAT is going on?!

While watching it I find myself liking Joe (the main character/stalker) but then he does something horrifying or stupid and I'm thinking to myself \"how could I like this character.\" None of the characters are likable but oddly enough if I had to choose it would be him. The character who he is obsessed with (Beck) is dimwitted, annoying and selfish and there is not one redeeming quality about her. Furthermore, I don't mean to sound rude but the character is supposed to be beautiful and the woman who plays her couldn't be anymore average looking. I think the girl who plays her best friend (Peach) would've been a better choice. She also has no redeeming qualities about her but at least she is beautiful. But I digress... I would definitely recommend checking this out if you're looking for something that's original with a touch of romance and creepiness.

Beck is so reckless with her life and whenever you think she's showing growth she makes another self deprecating move. Not to mention that she and her friends are all blind as bats to never see Joe lurking in plain site, just so unbelievable that i have to turn my brain off. It does have a few entertaining moments here and there and the storyline isn't horrible but the characters are ridiculous and it got old very fast.

The hero on a mission always finds a park right outside wherever he or she happens to be going. The cop or secret agent pursued by dozens of baddies with machine guns miraculously wends his or her way unharmed through a virtual curtain of gunfire. But the plot contrivance that annoys me most is the open curtain that enables the private investigator, the secret admirer or the estranged mother to effortlessly observe the object of their interest through an open window (see the final scene of Stella / Stella Dallas for the quintessential execution of this classic). Normal people close their curtains after dark or when they're undressing, but apparently not in any movie or TV show. Here, with You, we have an entire series virtually built around this classic contrivance. Our anti-hero - stalker and serial killer Joe - spends much of the series observing his prey through her apartment window. And the curtains of Bec's street-level apartment on a busy New York street are NEVER drawn, even when she's getting undressed, having wild sex or walking about in her lingerie. It's odd and unlikely once or twice, but when it happens consistently it becomes increasingly preposterous. The unavoidable conclusion is that Bec is a total exhibitionist and, in her own way, as kinky and weird as Joe, who is forever watching her every move from across the street. I guess that means they're made for each other, so maybe it adds to the romance. If you go for that kind of thing."},{"id":"rw4394329","title":"Made for Penn Badgley","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"13 October 2018","text":"I love this! It's dark but yet sexy at the same time.

Often you like Joe, the crazy protagonist more than you like the object of his desire. This is a nuanced portayal of how idolatry inevitably leads to disappointment. You are pulled into a constant battle between seeing Joe as a sociopathic, narcisssitic control freak, stalking an innocent, broken and eccentrially flawed womn child and a hopeless romatntic, being pulled apart by an impulsive, bipolar, selfishly money-grabbing user. The truth is, everyone is multi-faceted, with good and bad traits; this series lays this out starkly for all to see. When Joe kills, his victims are so repugnant, you feel no disgust - the first person narrative pulls you into his warped perspective, so it reduces even the most graphic violence to a comic book shallowness and absurdly amusing distraction. This is probbly as close to madness as any of us will get but it shows us that crossing that line is not as obviously distinct as we like to assume."},{"id":"rw4439909","title":"Good plot","starRating":"4/10","datePosted":"5 November 2018","text":"I am drawn in by Joe to see what more havoc he will wreak, but as for Beck, well ,she belongs on Sex and the City.

Joe is so stalkerish that he literally stands outside Beck's house & follows her wherever she goes & she doesn't even notice it...anyway, Penn as Joe is so brilliant that he deserves an Emmy for it to be honest...other characters are just here & there...Elizabeth's Beck character is annoying...Shay as Peach was good...I wish she had more episodes to do...the show sometimes gets dragged coz of the narration and all but Penn's voice make it worth bearing it...all in all, I would say Penn carried the whole show...overall, I would have rated it 6 star but only coz of Penn, I would give this 10 star...I don't know how they are gonna proceed with season two but I would definitely tune it to find out..."},{"id":"rw4458590","title":"Love love love","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"14 November 2018","text":"I don't find many shows that I enjoy throughout an entire season.

Over the years, my taste has become extremely specific and I am now too picky for my own good. I like to binge-watch and dive into the world depicted in the show and have the show influence my mood throughout the day. So, I don't like when things develop too fast (i.e. all movies :]). And I also get easily bored if content is slow, uninteresting and uneventful. That is, I don't like romantic comedies, sitcoms, slow dramas, horror, pointless thrillers, animation, or too unrealistic sci-fis. As you can see, there are very few shows that get me excited and hooked (usually dramas that contain some action, adventure, mystery and thriller). This one is a high-tempo drama (i.e. you don't have to wait 5 episodes before something actually happens). It's not as pacey as Suits, but certainly moves faster than the likes of Mad Men and even The Americans, yet doesn't feel rushed at all; so pace is well balanced. The characters are built well and thorough without wasting episodes presenting irrelevant info about them. It surprises you with unexpected things happening in unexpected times (like Ozark season 1, Goliath season 1, Fargo in that sense), and has the well-composed thriller (not overly done) of Prison Break, La Casa de Papel. Romance and the jokes in this one are far from corny and did not bother me at all. It was actually one of the few times I enjoyed romance in a show because the leads have such good chemistry. I also love when characters are really passionate about a field and want to build their lives around their passion. That is definitely the case here (i.e books and poetry).Cast is relatively unknown but you can so tell this is a quality show. I remember the lead from Margin Call, who played a stereotypical new Wall-Street hire, a plain character. Man, he has become a heck of an actor! Exceptional performance by him and I think might get some nominations. The show is Mr. Robot-like in the sense that the lead is a weird but likeable stalker and has these regular monologue of thoughts. And like Mr. Robot, the character fits the actor so well.I usually judge shows by the flaws that they have and this one has very few. Yes, the censored cursing is annoying and the lead character tailing people so closely without going noticed is a bit unrealistic (humorous, I guess). But that's about all the criticism I have. The first two episodes are just beautiful; midseason episodes are not as interesting as the rest, but definitely pleasing. If you're like me and stationary and unoriginal plots bore you, you should give it a try. This show is definitely unique."},{"id":"rw4458989","title":"Watchable","starRating":"5/10","datePosted":"14 November 2018","text":"I had never heard of this series or read any of the books so had no expectations what-so-ever going into it.Having watched it all the way to the end, I have to say it was just a little disappointing. It has a Pretty Little Liars feel to it so I can see the thin plot being stretched out over a few seasons.The main character Joe was portrayed in quite an interesting way but there was just never enough there to make you really care about him or even dislike him enough. None of the characters had any real substance to them and the only one I vaguely cared about was Paco.I liked that the story was being told from Joe's perspective and there was potential there to make things really gripping and creepy but it just didn't quite deliver.This is something to \"veg out\" in front of, it's watchable and mildly entertaining but doesn't require much thought.If you like things like, twilight, pretty little liars and 13 reasons you will probably enjoy this."},{"id":"rw4460956","title":"A truly brilliant series","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"15 November 2018","text":"A well written and acted out series in which we follow Joe a character who you can't help rooting for despite him having a bit of a dark side.This show is definitely worth the watch and I really hope they make a second series that does this first series justice.

It's a Dexter for teenagers. There is just too much drama between all the characters. Drama isn't bad, but teenage drama is something else, it's something annoying to watch when past a certain age. The concept is about the same as the success series Dexter, following a sociopath that is convinced he's doing great things, and this with the narrating voice of the sociopath, in this case played by Penn Badgley, that narrates you everything he does and thinks. It worked better with Dexter than with You, but that's just something about quality. For the rest the story isn't that bad, but it could have been much better. I guess there will be a second season, one that I probably will watch in the hope it gets better, but I have my doubts about that."},{"id":"rw4494519","title":"You","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"4 December 2018","text":"On the surface, Joe Goldberg is just another Joe Bloggs. Under the surface, he's a sociopath who falls in love with a girl who he meets at the book store where he works. He becomes obsessed with her, watches her, stalks her... And as he says, he'd do anything for her. And so he does. Not that she has any idea about it or asked him for it. He judges what and who is good and bad for her. He is the good and bad is everything else.\nI think a series like this was a long time coming. Season 2 has been announced before season 1 even started, so that's definitely something. You may not be a life changing series, but it's definitely one I'd say I've seen plenty of. It makes you think and wonder. I think that's a sign that something was done right there.\nAt first I wasn't sure how they want to continue this story in season 2, but turns out that Caroline Kepnes (based on whose novel the series You was made) wrote a book called Hidden Bodies. The second season of You will be based on it. I'm wondering if I should pick up the book.

You want to be seen!.\"I mean this isn't 'Gossip Girl' this is darker, so much more darker.\n'YOU' is a brand new psychological thriller based on the novel with the same name written by Caroline Kepnes.\nMeet 'Lonely Boy' Joe Goldberg an ordinary New York book store manager who quickly falls in love with customer Guinevere Beck a wannabe writer.This works perfectly due to his knowledge of the literacy world and even helps him flirt more effectively with Beck as time goes on. From the get go he is obsessive, he want's Beck in his life, slowly making his way through her social media pages building up an immense knowledge of her profile. Kind of like 'Criminal Minds' but not for anything good.\nIt turns out Beck has another man in the picture, a man that only seems to use her for sex, Joe finds this out and tries to give her the respect she so definitely wants but she doesn't budge. Until, Joe kidnaps her eh, bed partner Benji and when Beck tries to get in touch with him Joe has his phone controlling the narrative.Then there's Peach who is also obsessed with Beck and totally in love with her, so when Joe comes along, this guy who will do anything for Beck makes Peach decide this guy is a threat to their future together so does everything in her power to destroy Joe and Becks connection even going to the extremes of trying to guilt trip Beck into staying in Paris with her.\nOverall the show is very well written, it begins as a slow burn and gets more and more exciting as it goes on. Penn Badgley and Elizabeth Lail both take turns at narrating this series and Lail also takes her turn at being the stalker which is a nice wee turnaround fitting with the overall narrative, it's as if Joe has subconsciously rubbed off on Beck making her unknowingly take on those creepy traits (For example Joe gets a new girlfriend and Beck keeps turning up infront of them)\nIn a show filled with murder, lies and stalking where none of the characters are actually good 'YOU' is a show that hooks you wanting more.\nLuckily it's been renewed for a second season so we get to see more of what Joe will get up to and after that rollercoaster season finale the audience deserves much more to get their teeth into. The trailer below shows you that they wanted to give it a love story feel but as it goes on the darkness becomes more evident in that world. I would highly recommend this show that will have you criminal profiling everyone in your life: A high 8.5/10 from me on this one!!"},{"id":"rw4535480","title":"loved it","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"26 December 2018","text":"I find this series very interesting because it also shows how the stalker interprets the girl's behaviour which I think is important.

There are so many similarities, New York City, some of Beck's elite friends, usage of internet to get the blonde beauty to fall in love with him. I almost feel as though he's being type-cased.Regardless, Penn is an incredible actor and his female counterpart does very well too. I find his character Joe to be creepy as he searches fro her on the internet and follows her everywhere. He does initially come off as a bit of a wussy guy but then things shape up for him becoming more intense.It's not a scary show - it's a shallow psychological thriller -nothing compared to silence of the lambs. I don't find Joe to be a particularly as creepy as I find other leads in psychological thrillers that freak you out.Still really good, I feel like as a millennial I can definitely relate to some of the obstacles that Beck goes through.

Unfortunately, It didn't go as good as I was waiting. The Characters were typically like the average, the developing of the main character was remarkable (I mean, you really get involved in his poetic mind, you got to comprehend him and indeed feel affective empathy for him.) , but the secondary ones were not really deep. The storytelling is pretty cool, you get to feel you are undoubtedly on their complex brains and that could be weird at the distinct beginning but finally you will get used to it. Even though I feel bitterly like the whole plot was quite unbelievable, I mean, you can not just go over there leaving corpses behind you. To finish, I can say the end was ungood for me. It was a very hasty and absurd way to end it."},{"id":"rw4540655","title":"Great surprise","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"28 December 2018","text":"I was not expecting much, but totally worths the time.

But there were some like logical and social questions popping up while i ve whatched one episode to another. I mean it is still a movie, not everything has to be logical, but at least in such a real setting with a difficult topic there has be more relation to reality.The camera and lightning is great. Suspense everywhere. I liked it. Also i loved that in the pilot you are answering your questions by yourself throughout the movie.The cast is absolutely brilliant. Great acting and Penn Badgleys interpretation of the role is really on point, i think.But here is my opinion about the thinks i missed and didn´t really belive while watching the series:First thought: The police has no major role at all. We live in 2018, i think if there is so much killing going on in the same social field it is defenitely time for the FBI or criminal department to wake up.Second thought: The portrait of Beck is all in all that she is a smart insecure naive girl. I know that we know things she is not but she can´t defend herself in one second. They gave her the role of a classic blond social media princess but at least she is smart. So i wished sometimes she could use her smartness for more than writing her books. I know that we know things she don´t but i think for a sociopath the manipulation is not enough so that a intelligent girl would fall for everything.Thrid thought: Why there is so much killing going on. Sometimes i wished Joe would manipulate them instead of killing them. Like Littlefinger in Thrones.Last thought: Why the hell nobody gives a damn thing of Joe acting sociopathic. Not even therapist realised that he is the one that manipulates but it´s his job.So all in all a good series that lacks, in my opinion, sometimes in real life logic."},{"id":"rw4540938","title":"BINGED WATCHED AND I LOVE IT","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"28 December 2018","text":"I am Shay Fan and still miss gossip girl a lot , knowing Penn & Shay was staring , I decided to watch the pilot.

So, all the characters were given more humility, Beck is human and not a complete narcissistic cow, Joe is sexy, very together and cool in a creepy, Dexter way.

The production crew and actors certainly portrayed the plot and characters perfectly through and through.Being a book adaption, I was skeptical at first - we're all familiar with the disappointingly low quality of book-to-movie/series adaptions by now. Although there are discrepancies, I feel that these added even more value to the movie. For example, the series humanises Joe more and allows the viewer to gain a better understanding of the mindset and struggles of the mentally ill.The series could have turned out to be incredibly pretentious - book shop owner, NYC writer... but it somehow turned out to be quite the opposite. The series effectively points out a number of issues that many of us deal with on a daily basis, including the ease of \"social media stalking\", vindictive \"best friends\", drug abuse and of course, mental illness.The plot feels rather realistic, like Joe could definitely be somebody that you could meet in real life. Some of us have perhaps previously or currently fallen for a Joe (to varying degrees). He could even be somebody that you'd fall in love with and wouldn't know any better. It's actually quite disturbing how much information you can find out about somebody by simply clicking and scrolling through their social media activity.I had to go and read the book again after watching this series, I just can't get it out of my head. The worst part of the whole series was that it had to end. Other than that, I can't find a single complaint.I highly anticipate the second season."},{"id":"rw4544334","title":"The Things We do for Love.","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"29 December 2018","text":"I just finished watching the entire season last night. Some of the episodes are weaker than others, and I admit to falling asleep a couple of times, but on the whole, I recommend this series.The writing, acting and plotting are all strong; the characters are interesting, flawed and real in their own ways. I loved John Stamos as the pot smoking therapist.Some story lines begin strong and just trail off, and it is questionable that all of these \"missing\" people are just explained away by being in Europe or carousing somewhere in a drug-soaked haze. Surely there would be people in their lives who would question their long absences? This is the sort of plot hole that is necessary to move the story along, but is also the sort of weakness that ultimately brings it all down.One of the ironies of the series is that the main character has enough appeal and good looks to be successful romantically even without all the stalking and evil machinations. He doesn't need to do what he does in order to get the girl; surely a certain degree of persistence is required in the case of Beck (who is really quite unstable, an emotional mess, and not worth all the effort), but it's doable, he's is a genuine and lovable guy in many ways, but his tragic flaw, to the tragic detriment of his love interests, is that he can't just let things happen naturally, he must control the action and the outcome. He is unable to leave matters to fate and the frailties of the human heart. He is his own worst enemy, and a danger to the women who stumble into his orbit.I'm looking forward to the new season, but a little disturbed by how Season One ended. I'm not sure how he can come back from his actions, and how the viewer is still going to continue to indulge him based purely on his pleasant and seeming \"nice guy\" demeanor. I'm not really sure how we can go from here."},{"id":"rw4544529","title":"Plothole","starRating":"","datePosted":"29 December 2018","text":"A freaking bad scripted \"series\" with a scrappy end..."},{"id":"rw4544785","title":"A breath of fresh air","starRating":"","datePosted":"29 December 2018","text":"Impeccably written, great acting especially by Penn Badgley!\nUnsettling and uncomfortable in all the right places.

Unique way to tell the story by hearing Joe narrate with his inner dialog. Hearing what he is actually thinking about all the creepy stuff he does allows us an attempt to understand or perhaps justify his actions. Beck tells big lies, cheats etc. Joe will go ahead and kill anyone that threatens their relationship, and it seems as though he's really good at getting away with murder. Joe's body count is 4 that we see first hand and 2 others we assume he's responsible for. The eavesdropping online, and in-person is done way too easily to be even close to realistic. Somehow we're hoping Joe gets exposed, but we are perhaps rooting for him to succeed at times too.

I think a great deal of that is owed to Penn Badgley's portrayal; he is charming and caring and sweet while also being creepy and obsessive and intrusive. However, I wasn't kept on the edge of my seat and I was a little frustrated at parts but it was intriguing and I did still find it enjoyable to watch.I wanted to read Caroline Kepne's book, I added it to my to be read list at least two years ago but that is a very long list and I didn't get around to it. When I saw this show pop up on Netflix I realised it had the same premise and was happy to find that it was based on Kepne's book and that she is a consultant on the show as well. I read that when this show aired on Lifetime that the swearing was bleeped and some of the dialogue was hidden or removed? Thankfully it isn't that way on Netflix.I will say that the series did drag in the middle, they felt a little bit like filler episodes and a number of parts could be quite predictable. I would have liked to have had the supporting characters, especially Beck's friends, fleshed out a bit more, I know that they weren't the focus but for example I found Annika to be quite interesting.

I like that we're in the head of the stalker/obsessive psychopath and see everything from his delusional POV. That started me watching. Penn is impressive and is the only reason I keep watching. The actress who plays Beck and the character of Beck-both make me want to stop watching. She drags out the endings of words like a bad singer holding onto a note. I want to give benefit of doubt to her and the other characters. Since the story is in the POV of Joe, maybe this is how he is seeing the characters and how he wants them to be. Maybe Beck isn't as foolish, reckless, irresponsible and stupid as Joe sees her and needs her to be.I agree with other commenters who have opined that this should be a mini-series. It could be better and award winning. I was hoping for some cat and mouse-the genius of Joe vs. a thoughtful, clever and follow-through type cop/detective.

He's a \"niceguy\" who would be \"so perfect\" for the woman he desires if only she would \"see how good he is for her\". The object of he obsession, Beck, is a cute, flirtatious burgeoning writer who he idolizes in the most bizarre way and pushes to be her best, truest, most writer-est self. He basically hacks into her life by researching her social media, her friends and her interests. He hates her vapid friends and tries to pull her away from them any chance he gets.His obsessions constantly lead him into situations where he's broken into other characters homes, showed up at random events and searched computers/phones and always seems to be on the brink of being discovered at all times, wears a ball cap in public while stalking his love interest and and assaults her friends, and never seems to be noticed... by anyone, at all! In NYC!!!There is continuous lying, deceit, cheating and OUTRIGHT STALKING by a number of characters which becomes VERY TIRESOME as the series progresses. How does \"niceguy\" Joe get away with everything? He murders at least 3-4 characters without raising an eyebrow??Joe is an obsessive \"niceguy\" creep who keeps momentos of Beck's life, including a journal, her underwear and teeth of a former lover and wondered why she's terrified when she discovers these things kept away in a box??? He says he did it all for love!!!Beck's not that much of hero either. She keeps him at arms length for months until she dumps him and he finds a new, kindhearted girlfriend then Beck decides that he's ALL SHE EVER WANTED and seduces him back into her bed, only to reveal later that she's been having an affair with her handsome married therapist who is giving her counsel on her truly f'd up relationship.It's hard to feel bad for any of these terrible characters as they continuously destroy each other. I really only felt for Karen who was Joe's gf after Beck, a kind and gentle person who nurses her junkie friend back to health, and for a brief period, Paco, Joe's young neighbour with the junkie mom and abusive stepdad (until he proves to be a POS too!)Not sure what to say, I watched it all and didn't feel good about any of it. Performances were good, but the story was unnerving and I was truly disgusted by all the characters involved."},{"id":"rw4549360","title":"Super slow pace.","starRating":"3/10","datePosted":"31 December 2018","text":"It feel list looking Pretty little liars, mixed with gossip girl with a bit of Dexter flavor on top with the paste of a snail.

Before I say anything else, let me just give you some background information.\nYes, Penn Badgley was a favourite of mine in Gossip girl. Judge all you want, but it was all I watched for a good 6 months. Behind all the drama, gossip and Blair's daddy issues, it had a good message of family and unltimately made you feel like you learned something by the end of it. I saw that \"You\" was coming to Netflix and got excited. I came online and read the reviews. Ok yeah, he's cute. Ok yeah, he likes her. But stalking her and publicly touching yourself in front of her home? Watching her while she has sex with other guys? That is disgusting! Completely invading her privacy! His character deserves to be in jail! He's a pedophile and a killer! His character is really disturbing to me. This behaviour is not ok and I feel for young teenage girls who are going to watch this and think it's normal! Please report anyone who acts like this towards you! This is not love. Ending for me dosent really matter cause he honestly deserves to be in jail and her \"sad family issues\" kept dragging on. OH! To top it all off, he's also a cheater! So yeah... congrats!

It keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole time and keeps you guessing and trying to figure out what will happen next.I had to binge-watch this show because I was in a panic mode at the end of every episode. I guess this is because it was too good.The character of Joe Goldberg is very well written. He has good heart yet ends up doing things that might seem wrong in the eyes of the world. He's a lonely bookstore clerk in search of true love. Having been cheated on by his girlfriend Candace, he searches for someone who would truly love him and see the goodness in him. One fine day he meets a financially and emotionally struggling poetry student Guinevere Beck and becomes madly obsessed with her. His obsession leads him to slowly start paving his way into her life.Despite all that, the beauty of this show is that here the audience ends up sympathizing with the stalker rather than the girl. You start to feel that whatever he's doing is justified. All these things lead to an intense and fantastic finale.Penn Badgley fantastically played the obsessive lover. He was very much able to bring out the darkness within his character. Cheers to him!This show is an intense psychological thriller and believe me when I say this: It actually has the capacity to drive people crazy. I was hooked to it from the start to the end and it made me want more of it especially after the season finale. The good\nnews is that there will be a season 2. I would highly recommend this show if you're a fan of thrillers that play with your mind."},{"id":"rw4552329","title":"Unexpectedly great!","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"1 January 2019","text":"Dark and keeps you guessing.

However I didn't like Beck either she is so shallow sleeps with everyone - a guy who users her for sex, a random guy at a bar, Joe, then the married therapist does this girl have no morals? Her friends are also shallow, but she doesnt deserve to meet Joe! Joe stalks her in plain sight yeah wearing a hat with your collar up makes you unrecognisable to those that know you well! Openly standing across the street staring up at her windows all the time so obvious to anyone that sees him, he masterbates in public and he randomly attacks and kills people close to her, never any witnesses, leaves no clues, disposes of bosies, DNA everywhere etc the \"luckiest\" killer ever. He creeps me out which is maybe what is intended I'm unsure, I wanted him to be caught as there was a kind of smugness I got from him especially keeping the trophies. I'm also not sure why everyone compares it to dexter I loved dexter it was so complex and much deeper than this. I also enjoyed gossip girl although Penn was not my favourite character in that and yeah I was disappointed in gossip girl reveal ending!

For him, her, and everyone around them.The decent part is mainly about the acting and directing. The show has a creepy atmosphere and the lead actors and actresses are very convincing to a point where they even win the audience over and you might even temporarily care for them. You'll get a view inside a psychopath's acting, feeling and thinking and reasoning. This works for a few episodes, let's say 5 or 6.Unfortunately, after that, the show goes downhill. First of all, how the psychopath keeps getting away with non stop stalking is ridiculous. 2nd: him, his girl, as well as her girlfriends, get more annoying by the minute. Dialogue, actions, motivation become less and less credible, and become borderline stupidity. Characters become hollow, 2-dimensional and repetitive in their behavior.And to kill it off, in the end of the show, the stupidity is all that remains. Unless this is your first show ever, you may look in a constant state of surprise at how much stupidity two people can portray, just to keep a situation going on.

Anyway.Assuming you already know the story, I'd like to focus on the characters because, in my view, character depth is the best reason I give this series a 10/10.Beck: I love her; plus, she reminds me of myself sometimes. A golden hearted, strong girl whose only vulnerability is that she doesn't know where she belongs in this world, leading to insecurity and poor judgement when it comes to the people she surrounds herself with. But even then, she believes the best about others and is always there for them. I still believe her relationship with Joe was toxic from the beginning, but I don't blame her for that.Peach: Obsessive? Check. Manipulative? Check. Emotionally unstable? Double check. Do I hate her? No! This is interesting, because she is represented as the vicious girl whom everyone would be happier without, but to me she is far more likeable than Joe. Given the love and understanding she needed I think she had potential to improve herself. She didn't show in many episodes, though, so I didn't have the opportunity to see through her better.Joe (finally!!!): I may sound weird compared to other reviewers but I absolutely hate him. He is the most messed up, controlling person I have ever seen. He confuses love with emotional dependency and obsession, he is A KILLER and the most disturbing part is that he thinks he owns the right to 'play God' and get rid of any person who doesn't match his criteria. He gets heart broken by a cheating ex and yet there he goes and cheats on a lovely woman, Karen. He even framed an innocent man for his murders. He even killed Beck to save himself from getting caught. He shows no remorse, no responsibility and needs psychiatric help asap, before he does any more harm. I can only congratulate Penn for his incredible acting which triggered my deepest hatred towards his character.

However it was something really exciting to watch, its first two episodes and last two episodes were outstanding, the rest, not so much. Who the heck locks up someone in a soundproof cage, but does not think about its consequences? I felt that the script was pretty well-written, but certain aspects are just not logical, and triggers a certain kind of awkward feeling inside of me. Peach's head injury is gone in less than 3 days, the psycho always gets away with the murders as if he did not leave any traces behind to find evidence... I thought the whole season that Candace is dead, fine twist at the end to bring her back. This psycho character was exciting to watch, but I felt that there was not much of a character development, he goes in loops over and over in order to make Beck find her inner writer. I felt that Paco's childhood gets destroyed little by little in Season 1, though I thought he'd be the savior of the ill-minded psycho."},{"id":"rw4557602","title":"The fact i watched the whole series in two days....but..","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"3 January 2019","text":"The show does grab your attention and makes you want to know what happens next so if you enjoy this kind of show at all youll want to watch the whole season.SPOILERSSSSS\nThe real issue i had, and i know its just a show, but there are so many frustrating behaviors of characters on the show. We are so clearly shown that the people are supposed to be smart so its SOO frustrating to watch them make horrible decisions like once you knock the person trying to hurt you down, knock them again or run away..same with when using gun.

The character of Joe is very similar to Slater's character, JD, in the fact that he is so obsessed with his girlfriend that he'll go to such extremes as KILLING her friends to get her to live only for him. Beck is similar to Ryder's character, Veronica, in the fact that she falls for Joe's mind games and becomes a sort of spectacle to his crimes. Peach is similar to the main Heather, Heather Chandler, in the fact that she is so obsessive over Beck and will do anything to keep her under her control, and she even ends up dying at the hands of Joe, which is EXTREMELY similar to Heathers when Heather dies at the hands of JD.I don't know, I just thought it was pretty funny how similar the two stories are.

Joe was compelling from the get-go but he couldn't make up for everyone else being forgettable; nor could I get over the fact Joe and Beck's relationship just didn't . . . make sense.

After episode 6 the story keeps dragging and it loses it's focus. The whole dark and misterious mood from the beggining is gone and the series turn into silly romance and relationship drama until the final moments. Overall it's an average show, but only if don't take it too seriously."},{"id":"rw4561524","title":"Has Very Addictive Qualities but Needs Some Changes","starRating":"7/10","datePosted":"5 January 2019","text":"It took me several episodes to *really* get into this, the first couple were a little slow and I had to adjust to the tone of the whole thing. But after I did, I had to watch it all within 2 days.First let me say that the main character bothers me ( I have not read the book so can't say if it's the same in both adaptations) and as a character, she's inherently annoying. However, I'm not sure if the lead actress makes it worse, but I don't think her acting is very convincing and this lowers the quality overall. It's really hard to understand why Joe would even be so obsessed with someone so annoying, who is on the whole, more flawed almost than the murderer. Well... like attracts like so.. I guess I get it.I have to dock more points for the insufferable friends of Beck. They are very cringeworthy and the text convos between them all made me almost turn it off a few times, they were that bad. I wish the writers hadn't felt like they needed to rely on millennial valley-type girls and their different kitsch phrases and jokes to add anything to this.Shay Mitchell does a REALLY good job on this; best female role in this by far. I kept thinking that if Shay had been the lead, it might have been better, but then who would play the wicked, manipulative Peach that well.Penn Badgley is SO creepy, yet witty/ funny at moments and actually somewhat relatable. You start to understand, after a series of flashbacks, why he is the way he is. As if he wants to control others being hurt because he couldn't control what happened to him and so these obsessions he gets on with each and every girl is just a way to try to right what was so wrong. His performances carry the whole show and keep the element it relies on going and going. Without him and what he lends to the character, it'd probably have died out.On the whole, this show is SUSPENSEFUL, you never ever know what's going to come next. It's full of a BUNCH of messed up characters, as I said- many worse than the stalker/ murderer. At least his intent is in the right place, but others like Beck run around reckless while still trying to maintain the \"but I don't know what I do, I'm still endearing, right?\" image. It reminds me of a creepy cross between Castle, PLL and 50 Shades, with the NYC setting lending itself in a big way.If any of the aforementioned things appeal to you, check it out!"},{"id":"rw4561635","title":"Such a surprise!","starRating":"10/10","datePosted":"5 January 2019","text":"I am so happy this show is in Netflix! So dark and thrilling. Absolutely captivating!"},{"id":"rw4561800","title":"To you, in the fiction aisle.","starRating":"6/10","datePosted":"5 January 2019","text":"You flick through Netflix on a Thursday night after a gruelling double shift of waitressing. You don't give the documentaries a second glance, but something in the new releases catches your eye. Sharp cheekbones, piercing eyes...Is that Penn Badgley? You fondly recall him from your obsessive Gossip Girl days; you used to plaster your tumblr page with his smirks. You pretend that you are past that phase, much too old for such schoolgirl crushes, but secretly, you're intrigued. You press play.Badgley tries to mimic the charming, sociopathic murderers of television late (Hannibal, Dexter, even traces of Bickle) but you and so many others only remember and watch him because of Gossip Girl. He's cut from the same wealthy cloth that he so bitterly loathes from the outskirts of New York high society. But you don't care; he's cute, different, hot, and that's good enough for you. There are jabs at the literary and social elite in the script that are not written for you. You never read the book, so you wouldn't know of the Joe that is a literary double agent, who never went to college but beats them at their own snobbish games. You read like Benji does, never following your high school reading list, and secretly hoping that Dan Brown was acceptable nightstand decor (it is, but your instagram would never concede like that). You don't recognise most of these sly name drops; the show-runners know this, and so Great Expectations and Woody Allen becomes Donald Trump and some Kardashian (they're all the same, aren't they?). You giggle because these names you recognise. You like how Peach splits Joseph into two parts, with an affected British accent: Joooo-seph! Even their linguistics are phony, but you know you would do the same thing.The Joe from the book is nasty, monstrous. His voice is wry and sarcastic and bitter, laced with resentment in its aggressive second person. Live action Joe is too clean cut. Even when he's bent over, jerking off to old polaroids, his hair is perfectly kempt. And those cheekbones too. That's what you want. You don't want the possessive monster that fawns over any blonde that walks into his bookstore. You want the gorgeous stalker who you are somehow prepared to make excuses for. After all, Benji was human trash. He had to go, and who else was going to do it? The book probably has too much profanity, but the show doesn't have enough. You're head over heels for this guy. You don't see the bloodshed, the grime and the gore, because they cut to black before it gets too real. You don't know what you're missing.You find yourself sympathetic to Elizabeth Lail, too. She portrays everything that the Joes of this world would be entranced with: physically alluring, vulnerable, distracting, damaged goods. You don't have her daddy issues but you wish you did so that you would have something to write about. You dream of living that cliché; tortured New York artist with writer's block, and problems that are plot points. That would be easy; exciting, even. Where's the Beck from the book? Where's the closeted rich girl smearing 'poor me' like mascara? Where's the messed up twenty something writer who uses her poetry as a thinly veiled diary brimming with vanity? Where's the girl doing her MFA but has to look up solipsistic in the dictionary? You do the same when Joe mentions Paula Fox, and order it for your nightstand. You never touch it."},{"id":"rw4561859","title":"It's worth the watch, just be prepared for some eye rolls toward the female character.","starRating":"8/10","datePosted":"5 January 2019","text":"The shows pretty great and keeps you on your toes!

The lead should stick to audio books. His face has 2 expressions at best. Pretty sure he scratched his nose and got a splinter.The rest of the acting is 70s/80s B-Movie at best, especially by the female cast.I found myself watching and thinking that I don't care about any of these characters, I hope they all die so I can watch something else.I can only assume it's high rating on here is mostly to do with bots or employees of Netflix?"},{"id":"rw4562081","title":"Another show that cld have been a movie","starRating":"1/10","datePosted":"5 January 2019","text":"So many shows on Netflix that cld be a movie.
